The ethical impact of AI has been recognized as a social issue, and countries and organizations have formulated principles and guidelines on AI ethics, and laws and regulations will be enforced in Europe. Because these principles and guidelines are written in terms of philosophy and law, AI service providers, developers, and business users have the challenge of how they should practice the principles and guidelines to their AI systems. To address this challenge, we first analyzed cases of ethical problems caused by AI in the past and assumed that ethical problems could be linked to interactions between components of AI systems and stakeholders related to such systems. On the basis of this assumption, we then developed a methodology to comprehensively extract the ethical risks that an AI system poses. This methodology consists of two approaches. The first approach is to develop an AI ethics model that embodies ethics guidelines as necessary requirements for ethical AI systems and correlates these requirements with interactions. The second approach is an impact assessment process that uses the AI ethics models to extract ethical risks for individual AI systems. In this paper, we discuss the details of this methodology and show the results of an initial validation to verify the above assumption and the ease of the impact assessment process.",AI ethics;AI governance;responsible AI;impact assessment;risk-based approach,"Fujitsu Limited, Kawasaki, Japan; Fujitsu Limited, Kawasaki, Japan; Fujitsu Limited, Kawasaki, Japan; Fujitsu Limited, Kawasaki, Japan",20 Oct 2022,,,152.0,161.0,2770-6834,978-1-6654-6000-2,Stanford University; ,Ethics;Philosophical considerations;Conferences;Europe;Organizations;Regulation;Requirements engineering,artificial intelligence;ethical aspects,artificial intelligence systems;AI ethics guidelines;AI service providers;ethical risks;ethical AI systems;AI ethics impact assessment;requirement engineering,,2.0,27.0,IEEE,20 Oct 2022,IEEE,0.1841004184100418,0.1666666666666666,0.375,0.1902169701992332

Input, processing, and output are the different ethically relevant stages under which a spoken item or a speech navigates within the range of speech-processing modules. Employing the illocutionary force-content distinction, we specify and characterize the input-related ethical issues, the output-related ethical issues, and the processing-related ethical issues involved in speech processing. Together with illocutionary force-content distinction, we employ the data-information distinction to characterize the stage-wise ethical issues in the phenomenon of speech processing as the ethics of collecting (speech) data, the ethics of contextualizing (speech) data/information, and the ethics of releasing the con-textualized information (processed speech).

Therefore, a new ethical concept must be brought into focus: Technoethics for Emerging Digital Systems (TEDS). TEDS is presented as an integrative and innovative approach committed to an interdisciplinary perspective. Thereby, TEDS reflects all social areas of the human lifeworld in their ethical scope. With recourse to phenomenological methods, TEDS helps to address ethical implications which arise from deep interference of autonomous systems with the human lifeworld. The meaning of intentional structures and the problem of appresentations in the phenomenological sense still represents a blank gap in the current ethical discourse on the problem of data breaches. The findings provide methods for dealing with ethical challenges and explain the problem area of an appropriate technoethical use in the lifeworld. In this way, problems can already be avoided in the development process of artificial intelligence systems and their applications by specifically searching for blind spots in a technical and ethical manner. Furthermore, this approach helps to assure a technoethical use of autonomous systems in an appropriate way and ultimately leads to a limitation of damages – which may occur in case of malfunctions and data breaches of artificial intelligence systems – in the lifeworld of humans.

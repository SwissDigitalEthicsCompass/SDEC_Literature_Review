Using a path modeling methodology, we find evidence that, for ethics, moral disengagement is an antecedent to the TPB predictors of attitude, subjective norms, and perceived behavioral control (PBC). We show that the TPB predictors mediate the influence moral disengagement has on ethical behavioral intentions. Thus, to improve ethical behavior, reducing moral disengagement is critical. We find support for including both types of PBC (self-efficacy and locus of control) when modeling ethical behavior. We use four ethics scenarios and international data to test this model. We also evaluate potential positive influences on ethics in the workplace and find that recency of ethics training interacts with religiosity and activates it to reduce moral disengagement. We also find that principles-based ethics training enhances professionals’ self-efficacy to behave ethically. Experience, including time as a member in a professional accounting organization, increases both locus of control and self-efficacy to behave ethically. These variables—recency of ethical training, religiosity, principles-based professional ethics training, and experience—influence parts of the core TPB model, which in turn lead to improved ethical behavioral intentions.",,0.160427807486631,0.1666666666666666,0.1608199391723818,,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,,,,nan,,nan,nan,nan,,,,nan,nan,nan,

It remains unclear whether the scope of ethical dilemmas prompting an ethics consultation differ between specialties and if there are types of ethics consultations that are more or less frequently called based on the specialty initiating the ethics consult. This study retrospectively assessed the incidence and content of ethics consultations called by surgical vs. non-surgical specialties between January 1, 2013 to December 31, 2018 using our RedCap Database and information collected through the EMR via our Clinical and Translational Science Center. 548 total ethics consultations were analyzed (surgical n = 135, non-surgical n = 413). Our results demonstrate that more surgical consults originated from the ICU, as opposed to lower acuity units (45.9% vs. 14.3%, p ≤ 0.001), and surgical patients were more likely to have a DNR in place (37.5% vs. 22.2%, p = 0.002). Surgical specialties were more likely to call about issues relating to withholding/withdrawing life-sustaining treatment (p ≤ 0.001), while non-surgical specialties were more likely to call about issues related to discharge planning (p = 0.001). There appear to be morally relevant differences between consults classified as the “same” that are not entirely captured by the usual ethics consultations classification system. In conclusion, this study highlights the unique ethical issues experienced by surgical vs. non-surgical specialties. Ultimately, our data can help ethics consultation services determine how best to educate various hospital specialties to approach ethical issues commonly experienced within their field.",,0.1254901960784313,0.4,0.1317356572258533,2021.0,2023-11-06 14:05:12,2023-11-06 14:05:12,89–102,Publisher: Springer Verlag,ADP2PFZX,nan,nan,,,,nan,,nan,nan,nan,,,,nan,nan,nan,

Thomas; L. Arya; M. Hussain; S. R. M. Prasanna,2023.0,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10154932,IEEE Conferences,"Using speech act theory from the Philosophy of Language, this paper attempts to develop an ethical framework for the phenomenon of speech processing. We use the concepts of the illocutionary force and the illocutionary content of a speech act to explain the ethics of speech processing. By emphasizing the different stages involved in speech processing, we explore the distinct ethical issues that arise in relation to each stage. Input, processing, and output are the different ethically relevant stages under which a spoken item or a speech navigates within the range of speech-processing modules. Employing the illocutionary force-content distinction, we specify and characterize the input-related ethical issues, the output-related ethical issues, and the processing-related ethical issues involved in speech processing. Together with illocutionary force-content distinction, we employ the data-information distinction to characterize the stage-wise ethical issues in the phenomenon of speech processing as the ethics of collecting (speech) data, the ethics of contextualizing (speech) data/information, and the ethics of releasing the con-textualized information (processed speech). Immediate ethical issues that arise from the range of speech processing modules are distinguished from distant ethical issues. We also indicate the nature of ethical issues that arise from Speaker Independent speech technologies.",Speech acts;Ethics of speech data;AI ethics;Ethics of speech processing;Privacy;Ethics of illocutionary force,0.182741116751269,0.2272727272727272,0.1747164955851473,,,,,,,"Indian Institute of Technology Dharwad, Dharwad, India; Indian Institute of Technology Dharwad, Dharwad, India; Indian Institute of Technology Dharwad, Dharwad, India; Indian Institute of Technology Dharwad, Dharwad, India",23 Jun 2023,1.0,10.0,,978-1-6654-5713-2,,Ethics;Philosophical considerations;Navigation;Force;Speech processing,ethical aspects;speech processing,distant ethical issues;distinct ethical issues;ethical framework;illocutionary force-content distinction;immediate ethical issues;information;input-related ethical issues;output-related ethical issues;processed speech;processing-related ethical issues;Speaker Independent speech technologies;speech act theory;speech processing modules;stage-wise ethical issues,,,19.0,IEEE,23 Jun 2023,IEEE,0.0

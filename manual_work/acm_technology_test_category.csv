The approaches of the studies differ in how AI technology, ethics, role of technical artefacts and socio-technical aspects of AI are perceived. In addition, most studies define insufficiently what the connection between the process of embedding ethical frameworks to AI technology and the larger framework of AI ethics is. These deficiencies have caused that the concept of AI ethics and the construct of embedding ethical parameters into AI are used in an ambiguous, rather than in a complementary manner.One reason for the ambiguity within this field of research is due to a lack of a comprehensive conceptual framework for AI ethics in general. I intend to fill this void by grounding AI ethics as a subfield of philosophy of technology and applied ethics and presenting its main issues of study by examining recognized spheres of activities through the method of levels of abstraction [8].

By redeploying the AI4People framework, we develop a domain-relevant specification of five ethical principles in cybersecurity: beneficence, non-maleficence, autonomy, justice, and explicability. We then illustrate the advantages of this principlist framework by examining the ethical issues raised by four common cybersecurity contexts: penetration testing, distributed denial of service attacks (DDoS), ransomware, and system administration. These case analyses demonstrate the utility of this principlist framework as a basis for understanding cybersecurity ethics and for cultivating the ethical expertise and ethical sensitivity of cybersecurity professionals and other stakeholders.",AI ethics; Privacy; Cybersecurity ethics; DDoS attacks; Penetration testing; Principlism; Ransomware,,0167-4048,2021-10,2023-11-06 01:29:59,2023-11-06 01:29:59,,,,VXFLFHHR,0.2027027027027027,0.5454545454545454,0.3333333333333333,0.2349071940017134

In part, this is because AI ethics theory remains highly abstract, and of limited practical applicability to those actually responsible for designing algorithms and AI systems. Our previous research sought to start closing this gap between the ‘what’ and the ‘how’ of AI ethics through the creation of a searchable typology of tools and methods designed to translate between the five most common AI ethics principles and implementable design practices. Whilst a useful starting point, that research rested on the assumption that all AI practitioners are aware of the ethical implications of AI, understand their importance, and are actively seeking to respond to them. In reality, it is unclear whether this is the case. It is this limitation that we seek to overcome here by conducting a mixed-methods qualitative analysis to answer the following four questions: what do AI practitioners understand about the need to translate ethical principles into practice? What motivates AI practitioners to embed ethical principles into design practices? What barriers do AI practitioners face when attempting to translate ethical principles into practice?

Using kidney allocation as a case study, we conducted a randomized human-subject experiment where workers were presented with ethical dilemmas in various conditions, including no AI recommendations, recommendations from a similar AI, and recommendations from a dissimilar AI. We found that recommendations provided by a dissimilar AI had a higher overall effect on human decisions than recommendations from a similar AI. However, when humans and AI disagreed, participants were more likely to change their decisions when provided with recommendations from a similar AI. The effect was not due to humans’ perceptions of the AI being similar, but rather due to the AI displaying similar ethical values through its recommendations. We also conduct a preliminary analysis on the relationship between value similarity and trust, and potential shifts in ethical preferences at the population-level.",AI ethics; ethical preference; human reliance on AI,9798400702310,,2023,2023-11-06 01:29:49,2023-11-06 01:29:49,49–57,AIES '23,Association for Computing Machinery,BYSWACNN,0.1493506493506493,0.875,0.25,0.1882661343758282

I frame the question of ethical AI, and especially ethical social robots, as the question of what would make them worthy of human trust and actually eliciting human trust. Relying on a recent investigation of the multi-dimensionality of human trust, I lay out five criteria of trustworthiness-being competent, reliable, transparent, benevolent, and having ethical integrity. I will argue that an essential ingredient of such trustworthiness is norm competence-the ability to represent, comply with, and learn relevant social-moral norms (including fairness as one among many).

This paper proposes an approach to data curation for AI, grounded in feminist epistemology and informed by critical theories of race and feminist principles. The objective of this approach is to support critical evaluation of the social dynamics of power embedded in data for AI systems. We propose a set of fundamental guiding principles for ethical data curation that address the social construction of knowledge, call for inclusion of subjugated and new forms of knowledge, support critical evaluation of theoretical concepts within data and recognise the reflexive nature of knowledge.

Based on a qualitative analysis of technology workers tasked with integrating AI ethics into product development, we find that workers experience an environment where policies, practices, and outcomes are decoupled. We analyze AI ethics workers as ethics entrepreneurs who work to institutionalize new ethics-related practices within organizations. We show that ethics entrepreneurs face three major barriers to their work. First, they struggle to have ethics prioritized in an environment centered around software product launches. Second, ethics are difficult to quantify in a context where company goals are incentivized by metrics. Third, the frequent reorganization of teams makes it difficult to access knowledge and maintain relationships central to their work. Consequently, individuals take on great personal risk when raising ethics issues, especially when they come from marginalized backgrounds.

There are numerous initiatives that aim to develop the principles and guidance to ensure that the development, deployment and use of AI are ethically acceptable. What is generally unclear is how organisations that make use of AI understand and address these ethical issues in practice. While there is an abundance of conceptual work on AI ethics, empirical insights are rare and often anecdotal. This paper fills the gap in our current understanding of how organisations deal with AI ethics by presenting empirical findings collected using a set of ten case studies and providing an account of the cross-case analysis. The paper reviews the discussion of ethical issues of AI as well as mitigation strategies that have been proposed in the literature. Using this background, the cross-case analysis categorises the organisational responses that were observed in practice. The discussion shows that organisations are highly aware of the AI ethics debate and keen to engage with ethical issues proactively. However, they make use of only a relatively small subsection of the mitigation strategies proposed in the literature. These insights are of importance to organisations deploying or using AI, to the academic AI ethics debate, but maybe most valuable to policymakers involved in the current debate about suitable policy developments to address the ethical issues raised by AI.",Ethics; Artificial intelligence; AI policy; Case study; Organisational response,,0951-5666,2022-03,2023-11-06 01:30:00,2023-11-06 01:30:00,23–37,,,A8WHBU5L,0.1415929203539823,0.3333333333333333,0.3333333333333333,0.1597741697444135

We designed a test set using four dilemma scenarios and questionnaire items based on a theoretical framework for ethics, legal, and social issues (ELSI). We found that country and age are the most informative sociodemographic categories for predicting attitudes for AI ethics.

Most of the works that examine the interplay between the field of arts and AI ethics concern digital artworks, largely exploring the potential of computational tools in being able to surface biases in AI systems. In this paper, we investigate a complementary direction–that of uncovering the unique socio-cultural perspectives embedded in human-made art, which in turn, can be valuable in expanding the horizon of AI ethics. Through semi-structured interviews across sixteen artists, art scholars, and researchers of diverse Indian art forms like music, sculpture, painting, floor drawings, dance, etc., we explore how non-Western ethical abstractions, methods of learning, and participatory practices observed in Indian arts, one of the most ancient yet perpetual and influential art traditions, can shed light on aspects related to ethical AI systems. Through a case study concerning the Indian dance system (i.e. the ‘Natyashastra’), we analyze potential pathways towards enhancing ethics in AI systems.

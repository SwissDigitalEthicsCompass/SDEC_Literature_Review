It gives practical guidance on how to build barriers against threats. In the age of artificial intelligence (AI), ethics has attained a completely different level of significance and debate. The chapter discusses some of the key issues to consider around ethics and AI, including artificial stupidity and data trustworthiness. Privacy starts with data ownership. The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) has stringent stipulations around the various rights of individuals around the personal data. It brings personal data into a complex and protective regulatory regime. AI programs have increased vulnerabilities because there are more difficult‐to‐identify places to inject and bury threat vectors. The chapter provides information on cybersecurity assurance practices and industry standards for cybersecurity compliance. AI is also a great tool for identifying cyber‐threats. This is one of the biggest emerging applications of AI techniques.",,NA; NA,,,,193,206,,9781119709176,,Artificial intelligence;Ethics;Business;Privacy;Economics;Training;Decision making,,,,,,,12 Jul 2022,Wiley

The target specification was a system with 19 EEG channels and data stored onto the smartphone via a Wi-Fi connection. The hardware was developed using three ADS1299 integrated circuits, and the game engine, Unity, was used to develop the smartphone app. An evaluation of the system was conducted using recordings of alpha waves during periods of eye closure in participants (Bland-Altman statistical comparison with a clinical grade EEG system). The smartphone was also used to deliver time-locked auditory stimuli using an oddball paradigm to evaluate the ability of the developed system to acquire event related potentials (ERP) during sitting and walking. No significant differences were found for the alpha wave peak amplitude, frequency and area under the curve for the intra-system (two consecutive periods of alpha waves) or inter-system (developed smartphone-based EEG system versus FDA-approved system) comparisons. ERP results showed the peak amplitude of the auditory P300 component to deviant tones was significantly higher when compared to standard tones for sitting and walking activities.

However, a major caveat in utilising MRI is the significant amount of time required to manually segment the anatomy of interest. To overcome this limitation, we implemented a fully automatic method for the 3D segmentation of thoracic vertebrae, including vertebral body and posterior elements, of healthy adolescents and patients with Adolescent Idiopathic Scoliosis (AIS) using MRI data. 62 MRI scans were obtained from 3 healthy volunteers and 25 patients with AIS. A state-of-the-art deep-learning network for segmentation was trained using image patches of the apical vertebra (T7, T8, T9 or T10) extracted from 20 AIS patient MRIs. Ad-hoc data augmentation was adopted to represent the unlabeled vertebral levels in the dataset (T5-T6, T11-T12). The vertebral levels T5-T12 were then segmented for the remaining MRI datasets by feeding to the network the MRI patches generated by translating a window of fixed size and stride onto the MRI volume. The mean dice score coefficient for the AIS patient vertebral levels T5-T12 was of 87% ± 4.3%, which was comparable to the performance achieved by two experts. On average, 93% and 97% of the MRI segmented slices were considered clinically acceptable morphological reconstructions of AIS and healthy volunteer vertebrae, respectively. The proposed method can be considered as the first step towards more routine MRI-based imaging of AIS osseous deformities, reducing the cumulative exposure of young patients to ionising radiation.",Deep learning;CNN;segmentation;scoliosis;MRI;vertebral body;posterior process;AIS,"Centre for Children’s Health Research, Biomechanics and Spine Research Group, Institute of Health and Biomedical Innovation (IHBI), Queensland University of Technology, Brisbane, QLD, Australia; Centre for Children’s Health Research, Biomechanics and Spine Research Group, Institute of Health and Biomedical Innovation (IHBI), Queensland University of Technology, Brisbane, QLD, Australia; Centre for Children’s Health Research, Biomechanics and Spine Research Group, Institute of Health and Biomedical Innovation (IHBI), Queensland University of Technology, Brisbane, QLD, Australia; Centre for Children’s Health Research, Biomechanics and Spine Research Group, Institute of Health and Biomedical Innovation (IHBI), Queensland University of Technology, Brisbane, QLD, Australia; Centre for Children’s Health Research, Biomechanics and Spine Research Group, Institute of Health and Biomedical Innovation (IHBI), Queensland University of Technology, Brisbane, QLD, Australia; School of Clinical Sciences, Queensland University of Technology, Brisbane, QLD, Australia; Centre for Children’s Health Research, Biomechanics and Spine Research Group, Institute of Health and Biomedical Innovation (IHBI), Queensland University of Technology, Brisbane, QLD, Australia",21 Jun 2021,,,86811,86823,2169-3536,,Queensland University of Technology(grant numbers:1200000281); Children’s Health Queensland(grant numbers:SSA/14/QRCH/411); Mater Health Human Research Ethics Committees(grant numbers:14/88/AM03); ,Magnetic resonance imaging;Artificial intelligence;Three-dimensional displays;Image segmentation;Training;Surgery;Pathology,biomechanics;biomedical measurement;biomedical MRI;bone;diseases;image segmentation;learning (artificial intelligence);medical image processing;neurophysiology;orthopaedics;patient treatment,MRI datasets;MRI patches;MRI volume;clinically acceptable morphological reconstructions;MRI-based imaging;AIS osseous deformities;automatic segmentation;vertebral anatomy;Adolescent Idiopathic Scoliosis;nonionising imaging modality;scoliosis patients;thoracic vertebrae;vertebral body;MRI scans;deep-learning network;image patches;apical vertebra;Ad-hoc data augmentation,,,39,CCBY,31 May 2021,IEEE

This paper demonstrates deep learning approaches to estimate ankle joint power from two Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) sensors attached at foot and shank. The purpose of this study was to investigate deep learning models in estimating ankle joint power in practical scenarios, in terms of variance in walking speeds, reduced number of extracted features and inter-subject model adaption. IMU data was collected from nine healthy participants during five walking trials at different speeds on a force-plate-instrumented treadmill while an optical motion tracker was used as ground truth. Three state-of-the-art deep neural architectures, namely Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and, fusion of CNN and LSTM (CNN-LSTM), were developed, trained, and evaluated in predicting ankle joint power by extracting few simple, meaningful features. The proposed architectures were found efficient and promising with higher estimation accuracies (correlation coefficient, R > 0.92 and adjusted R-squared value > 83%) and lower errors (mean squared error <; 0.06, and mean absolute error <; 0.13) in inter-participant evaluations.

Besides being daily companions, so-called mHealth applications have the potential to enable individuals to collect data, document issues, and share them with healthcare professionals to better adjust medical treatment, side effects, or quality of life. While patient empowerment should be a paramount goal, the setup of these applications in a reliable and communication-effective way is under discussion. In particular, including mHealth applications in the clinical practice routine is crucial to boost their development. Security concerns are of utmost importance as such applications deal with personal data. Considering the sensitive nature of many of the involved data, a trustworthy transfer protocol to the respective health care providers is essential to convince potential users. On the same grounds, healthcare providers, which represent another major stakeholder, might be skeptical of utilizing mHealth applications. This issue is often not prioritized by app developers, and there is a multitude of apps lacking clear and transparent data transfer concepts with a focus on both security and usability. In the following, we present and discuss two different approaches for managing and reporting sensitive clinical information and their secure inter-sectoral transfer. Both use cases are currently implemented into clinical practice, and their applicability is under constant evaluation. Besides, to empower inter-sectoral communication, both approaches have been developed in close collaboration with healthcare providers to maximize both communication and effectiveness of the mHealth applications. Based on our work, we conclude that while mHealth applications can be important in many aspects of improving health care, there are often significant limitations of mHealth-based communication, which can hamper its integration in clinical settings. To overcome these limitations, we show how to apply and re-elaborate on existing security and communication strategies.

Severity Assessment of Social Anxiety Disorder Using Deep Learning Models on Brain Effective Connectivity,IEEE Access,9,,10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3089358,A. Al-Ezzi; N. Yahya; N. Kamel; I. Faye; K. Alsaih; E. Gunaseli,2021,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9454451,IEEE Journals,"Neuroimaging investigations have proven that social anxiety disorder (SAD) is associated with aberrations in the connectivity of human brain functions. The assessment of the effective connectivity (EC) of the brain and its impact on the detection and medication of neurodegenerative pathophysiology is hence a crucial concern that needs to be addressed. Nevertheless, there are no clinically certain diagnostic biomarkers that can be linked to SAD. Therefore, investigating neural connectivity biomarkers of SAD based on deep learning models (DL) has a promising approach with its recent underlined potential results. In this study, an electroencephalography (EEG)-based detection model for SAD is constructed through directed causal influences combined with a deep convolutional neural network (CNN) and the long short-term memory (LSTM). The EEG data were classified by applying three different DL models, namely, CNN, LSTM, and CNN + LSTM to discriminate the severity of SAD (severe, moderate, mild) and healthy controls (HC) at different frequency bands (delta, theta, alpha, low beta, and high beta) in the default mode network (DMN) under resting-state condition. The DL model uses the EC features as input, which are derived from the cortical correlation within different EEG rhythms for certain cortical areas that are more susceptible to SAD. Experimental results revealed that the proposed model (CNN + LSTM) outperforms the other models in SAD recognition. For our dataset, the highest recognition accuracies of 92.86%, 92.86%, 96.43%, and 89.29%, specificities of 95.24%, 95.24%, 100%, and 90.91%, and sensitivities of 85.71%, 85.71%, 87.50%, and 83.33% were achieved by using CNN + LSTM model for severe, moderate, mild, and HC, respectively.

However, there are relatively few non-invasive and/or non-proprietary systems to monitor and record patient-specific lung condition in real-time. In this paper, we present a CARE network data acquisition and monitoring system (CARENet) to automate data collection and to remotely monitor patient-specific lung condition and ventilation parameters. The automated system acquires VWD from a mechanical ventilator using a data acquisition device (DAQ), stores data in network-attached storage (NAS), and processes VWDs via a data management platform (DMP) web application. The web application enables real-time and retrospective model-based monitoring and analysis of clinical MV data. In particular, CARENet provides detailed breath-by-breath patient-specific respiratory mechanics, as well as the overall trends assessing changes in patient condition.

Using agent-based modeling (ABM), we incorporate heterogeneity in agent attributes and self-learning by the agents that are reflective of real-world marketplaces. Our research augments the existing studies on the effect of and reputation systems in such market places. Extensive simulations using ABM indicate that ratings of the data sets as a feedback mechanism plays an important role in improving the quality of said data sets, and hence the reputations of producers. While such marketplaces are evolving, regulators have started enacting varying rules to oversee the appropriate functioning of such marketplaces, to minimize market distortions. In one of the first such studies, we integrate regulatory interventions in a marketplace model to analyze the impacts of various types of regulations on the functioning of an AIM.

The first approach proceeds top-down from non-formalizable, cognitive, uncaused, and chaotic human consciousness towards purposeful and sustainable human-machine interaction. The second approach proceeds bottom-up from intelligent machines towards high-end computing and is based on formalizable models leveraging multi-agent architectures. The resulting work reviews the extent, the merging points, and the potential of hybrid artificial intelligence frameworks that accept the idea of strong artificial intelligence. These models concern the pairing of connectionist and cognitive architectures, conscious and unconscious actions, symbolic and conceptual realizations, emergent and brain-based computing, and automata and subjects.

To ensure that fundamental principles such as beneficence, respect for human autonomy, prevention of harm, justice, privacy, and transparency are respected, medical machine learning systems must be developed responsibly. Many high-level declarations of ethical principles have been put forth for this purpose, but there is a severe lack of technical guidelines explicating the practical consequences for medical machine learning. Similarly, there is currently considerable uncertainty regarding the exact regulatory requirements placed upon medical machine learning systems. This survey provides an overview of the technical and procedural challenges involved in creating medical machine learning systems responsibly and in conformity with existing regulations, as well as possible solutions to address these challenges. First, a brief review of existing regulations affecting medical machine learning is provided, showing that properties such as safety, robustness, reliability, privacy, security, transparency, explainability, and nondiscrimination are all demanded already by existing law and regulations—albeit, in many cases, to an uncertain degree. Next, the key technical obstacles to achieving these desirable properties are discussed, as well as important techniques to overcome these obstacles in the medical context. We notice that distribution shift, spurious correlations, model underspecification, uncertainty quantification, and data scarcity represent severe challenges in the medical context. Promising solution approaches include the use of large and representative datasets and federated learning as a means to that end, the careful exploitation of domain knowledge, the use of inherently transparent models, comprehensive out-of-distribution model testing and verification, as well as algorithmic impact assessments.",Algorithmic fairness;ethical machine learning;explainability;medical device regulation;medical machine learning;privacy;reliability;robustness;safety;security;transparency,"DTU Compute, Technical University of Denmark, Lyngby, Denmark; Department of Computer Science, Kiel University, Kiel, Germany; Institute for IT Security (ITS), Universität zu Lübeck, Lübeck, Germany; Fraunhofer Institute for Digital Medicine MEVIS, Bremen, Germany; Institute for Electrical Engineering in Medicine (IME), Universität zu Lübeck, Lübeck, Germany; Department of Computer Science, Kiel University, Kiel, Germany; Institute for Electrical Engineering in Medicine (IME), Universität zu Lübeck, Lübeck, Germany; UniTransferKlinik Lübeck GmbH, Lübeck, Germany; UniTransferKlinik Lübeck GmbH, Lübeck, Germany; Institute for Electrical Engineering in Medicine (IME), Universität zu Lübeck, Lübeck, Germany; Institute for Electrical Engineering in Medicine (IME), Universität zu Lübeck, Lübeck, Germany",7 Jun 2022,,,58375,58418,2169-3536,,"German Federal Ministry for Economic Affairs and Climate Action (BMWK) through the AI Space for Intelligent Health Systems (KI-SIGS) Project; several universities, research institutions, and private companies in northern Germany; Academy of Sciences and Humanities, Hamburg (by paying the open access fees); KI-SIGS Project; ",Machine learning;Regulation;Ethics;Artificial intelligence;Medical diagnostic imaging;Privacy;Medical services,data privacy;ethical aspects;health care;law;learning (artificial intelligence),existing regulations;medical context;federated learning;responsible regulatory conform machine learning;medical care;medical machine learning systems,,3,436,CCBY,27 May 2022,IEEE

The proposed framework, in its current form, allows assessing embedded levels of AXAI for delineating ML systems in a three-dimensional space. The AXAI framework quantifies comprehensibility in terms of the readiness of users to apply the acquired knowledge and assesses predictive accuracy in terms of the ratio of test and training data, training data size and the number of false-positive inferences. For establishing a chain of responsibility, accountability is measured in terms of the inspectability of input cues, data being processed and the output information.

To solve TOWE, it is important to consider the surrounding words of opinion words as well as the opinion targets. Although most existing works have captured the opinion target using Deep Neural Networks (DNNs), they cannot effectively utilize the local context, i.e. relationship among surrounding words of opinion words. In this work, we propose a novel and powerful model for TOWE, Gated Relational target-aware Encoder and local context-aware Decoder (GRED), which dynamically leverages the information of the opinion target and the local context. Intuitively, the target-aware encoder catches the opinion target information, and the local context-aware decoder obtains the local context information from the relationship among surrounding words. Then, GRED employs a gate mechanism to dynamically aggregate the outputs of the encoder and the decoder. In addition, we adopt a pretrained language model Bidirectional and Auto-Regressive Transformer (BART), as the structure of GRED to improve the implicit language knowledge. Extensive experiments on four benchmark datasets show that GRED surpasses all the baseline models and achieves state-of-the-art performance.

According to the recent statistical survey reports, the increasing mortality rate is due to high blood pressure, high cholesterol, the use of tobacco, obesity, and an inconsistent pulse rate. It is difficult and time-consuming to investigate the various variations of these factors and their impact on Coronary Artery Disease (CAD). Therefore, it is necessary to use modern approaches to diagnose the disease early and minimize the mortality rate. The fields of machine learning and data mining have a wide research dimension and various novel techniques that could help in the prediction of CAD in its early stages and identify their patterns and behaviors in a huge amount of data. The results of such predictions will aid the clinical staff in decision making and early diagnosis. In such a scenario, we proposed a quantum version of the Fully Convolutional Neural Network (FCQ-CNN) for Ischemic Heart Disease (IHD) classification. The proposed model evaluates the quantum circuit-based technique that was inspired by convolutional neural networks, a very successful machine learning model. This method provides  $O(log (n))$  depth for  $n$  qubits, reducing the number of parameters and allowing for effective training and testing of real quantum devices. The model has been evaluated by considering the IHD dataset after the data has been cleaned and filtered through the Maximally Relevant Minimally Redundancy (MRMR) filter. For dimension reduction, a Support Vector Machine along with Recursive Feature Elimination (SVM-RFE) has been considered. Initially, the model is tested with 20% of the whole dataset and gets the promising results of a testing accuracy of 84.6% with a testing loss of 0.28. By taking into account the same optimal parameters, the proposed model outcomes are compared to those of the classical Optimized Convolution Neural Network (Optimized-CNN) and Fully Connected Neural Network (FCNN) models.

In view of that, this paper proposes a strategy of performing CL along the dimensional direction instead of along the batch direction as done in conventional contrastive learning, named Dimensional Contrastive Learning (DimCL). DimCL aims to enhance the feature diversity, and it can serve as a regularizer to prior SSL frameworks.

The cause is very often the imbalance of training data, that is, unequal distribution of data between the classes of an attribute. Previous studies showed that lower levels of balance in protected attributes are related to higher levels of unfairness in the output. In this paper we contribute to the current status of knowledge on balance measures as risk indicators of systematic discriminations by studying imbalance on two further aspects: the intersectionality among the classes of protected attributes, and the combination of the target variable with protected attributes. We conduct an empirical study to verify whether: i) it is possible to infer the balance of intersectional attributes from the balance of the primary attributes, ii) measures of balance on intersectional attributes are helpful to detect unfairness in the classification outcome, iii) the computation of balance on the combination of a target variable with protected attributes improves the detection of unfairness. Overall the results reveal positive answers, but not for every combination of balance measure and fairness criterion.

On the Effectiveness of BGP Hijackers That Evade Public Route Collectors,IEEE Access,11,,10.1109/ACCESS.2023.3261128,A. Milolidakis; T. Bühler; K. Wang; M. Chiesa; L. Vanbever; S. Vissicchio,2023,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10078883,IEEE Journals,"Routing hijack attacks have plagued the Internet for decades. After many failed mitigation attempts, recent Internet-wide BGP monitoring infrastructures relying on distributed route collection systems, called route collectors, give us hope that future monitor systems can quickly detect and ultimately mitigate hijacks. In this paper, we investigate the effectiveness of public route collectors with respect to future attackers deliberately engineering longer hijacks to avoid being recorded by route collectors. Our extensive simulations (and attacks we device) show that monitor-based systems may be unable to observe many carefully crafted hijacks diverting traffic from thousands of ASes. Hijackers could predict whether their attacks would propagate to some BGP feeders (i.e., monitors) of public route collectors. Then, manipulate BGP route propagation so that the attack never reaches those monitors. This observation remains true when considering plausible future Internet topologies, with more IXP links and up to 4 times more monitors peering with route collectors. We then evaluate the feasibility of performing hijacks not observed by route collectors in the real-world.

Current deep learning based 3D-HPSE networks that takes video input have focused on improving temporal consistency among sequence of 3D joints by supervising acceleration error between predicted and ground-truth human motion. However, these methods overlooked the geometric misalignments of persistent discrepancy between geometric paths drawn by sequence of predicted joints and that of ground-truth joints. To this end, we propose Joint Path Alignment (JPA) framework, a model-agnostic approach that mitigates geometric misalignments by introducing Temporal Procrustes Alignment Regularization (TPAR) loss that performs group-wise sequence learning of joint movement paths. Unlike previous methods that rely solely on per-frame supervision for accuracy, our framework adds sequence-level accuracy supervision with TPAR loss by performing Procrustes analysis on the geometric paths drawn by sequences of predicted joints.

Although highly expressive, deep neural networks are black-box models, making their usage challenging in this safety-critical applications of autonomous racing. On the other hand, physics-based models provide high safety guarantees for the predicted trajectory but lack accuracy. The method presented in this paper targets this trade-off. We introduce a method to predict the trajectories of opposing racecars with deep neural networks considering physical constraints to restrict the output and to improve its feasibility. We report the method’s performance against an LSTM-based encoder-decoder architecture on data acquired from multi-agent racing simulations. The proposed method outperforms the baseline model in prediction accuracy and robustness. Still, it fulfills quality guarantees of smoothness and consistency of the predicted trajectory and prevents out-of-track predictions. Thus, a robust real-world application of the model with high prediction accuracy is proven.

Due to the large volume and complexity of today's KG-driven approaches, enormous resources are spent to utilize the complex AI approaches. Efficient usage of the resources like hardware and power consumption is essential for sustainable KG-based ML technologies. This paper introduces the ethical and sustainability considerations, challenges, and optimizations in the context of KG-based ML.

We also describe significant trade-offs and alternative options for dedicated scenarios enriched through existing and reported ethical and sustainability issues in AI-driven approaches and research. These include, e.g., efficient hardware usage guidelines; or the trade-off between transparency and accessibility compared to the risk of manipulability and privacy-related data disclosure.

However, running randomised field experiments is not always desired, possible or even ethical in the development of automotive embedded software. In the face of such restrictions, we propose the use of the Bayesian propensity score matching technique for causal inference of observational studies in the automotive domain. In this paper, we present a method based on the Bayesian propensity score matching framework, applied in the unique setting of automotive software engineering. This method is used to generate balanced control and treatment groups from an observational online evaluation and estimate causal treatment effects from the software changes, even with limited samples in the treatment group. We exemplify the method with a proof-of-concept in the automotive domain. In the example, we have a larger control (Nc = 1100) fleet of cars using the current software and a small treatment fleet (Nt = 38), in which we introduce a new software variant. We demonstrate a scenario that shipping of a new software to all users is restricted, as a result, a fully randomised experiment could not be conducted. Therefore, we utilised the Bayesian propensity score matching method with 14 observed covariates as inputs. The results show more balanced groups, suitable for estimating causal treatment effects from the collected observational data. We describe the method in detail and share our configuration.

Recent advances in natural language processing have shown that it is possible to classify moral values expressed in text at scale. Morality classification relies on human annotators to label the moral expressions in text, which provides training data to achieve state-of-the-art performance. However, these annotations are inherently subjective and some of the instances are hard to classify, resulting in noisy annotations due to error or lack of agreement. The presence of noise in training data harms the classifier's ability to accurately recognize moral foundations from text. We propose two metrics to audit the noise of annotations. The first metric is entropy of instance labels, which is a proxy measure of annotator disagreement about how the instance should be labeled. The second metric is the silhouette coefficient of a label assigned by an annotator to an instance. This metric leverages the idea that instances with the same label should have similar latent representations, and deviations from collective judgments are indicative of errors. Our experiments on three widely used moral foundations datasets show that removing noisy annotations based on the proposed metrics improves classification performance.11Our code can be found at: https://github.com/negar-mokhberian/noise-audits.",crowd-sourcing;annotation;ambiguity;subjective annotations;noisy annotations,"Information Sciences Institute, University of Southern California; Amsterdam School of Communication Research, University of Amsterdam; Information Sciences Institute, University of Southern California; Information Sciences Institute, University of Southern California; Information Sciences Institute, University of Southern California",23 Mar 2023,,,147,154,,978-1-6654-5661-6,,Training;Ethics;Annotations;Text recognition;Social networking (online);Refining;Training data,image classification;learning (artificial intelligence);natural language processing;pattern classification;sentiment analysis,annotator disagreement;classification performance;classifier;human annotators;instance labels;metric is entropy;metric leverages;moral expressions;moral foundations;moral values;morality classification;natural language processing;noise audits improve moral foundation classification;noisy annotations;training data,,,34,IEEE,23 Mar 2023,IEEE

Indeed, the ""bias in-bias out"" problem represents one of the most significant risks of discrimination, which encompasses technical fields, as well as ethical and social perspectives. We contribute to the current studies of the issue by proposing a data quality measurement approach combined with risk management, both defined in ISO/IEC standards. For this purpose, we investigate imbalance in a given dataset as a potential risk factor for detecting discrimination in the classification outcome: specifically, we aim to evaluate whether it is possible to identify the risk of bias in a classification output by measuring the level of (im)balance in the input data. We select four balance measures (the Gini, Shannon, Simpson, and Imbalance ratio indexes) and we test their capability to identify discriminatory classification outputs by applying such measures to protected attributes in the training set. The results of this analysis show that the proposed approach is suitable for the goal highlighted above: the balance measures properly detect unfairness of software output, even though the choice of the index has a relevant impact on the detection of discriminatory outcomes, therefore further work is required to test more in-depth the reliability of the balance measures as risk indicators.

We recognize that these AI digital tools are a vital aspect of future technological development, but they require input from various sectors in addressing ethics and compliance design. We survey the current landscape of published AI-specific regulatory frameworks and known engineering design process methods. Using a product lifecycle approach, we also introduce a trans-disciplinary framework to address AI ethics and compliance via design. This product lifecycle approach considers several principles: a Human-Centered Design for Risk Assessment, Functional Safety and Risk Management Standardization, and Continuous Governance throughout Product Lifecycle. Establishing risk management throughout AI product lifecycles can ensure accountability for AI product use cases. In addition, by utilizing previous Functional Safety considerations we can create safety mechanisms throughout the product lifecycle of AI digital tools. Finally, establishing in-field testing for continuous governance will enable the flexibility for new compliance standards and transparency.

Innis and M. McLuhan about the role of mass media in the formation of modern society, where a person's access to information - working with big data and participating in the production of information - is the main factor in the shift in the perception of values. The shift in the perception of the values of the digital society in our understanding is the transformation of the ideas of IT specialists about significant phenomena that arise as a result of their involvement in the process of producing and analyzing information. Involvement in the production of information can be considered in several ways, for example, as the creation of information content, or as the creation of mechanisms, software, devices providing the creation of tools for the production and analysis of information. Shifts in the perception of information, in our opinion, are determined by the nature of the attitude to information and depend on the professional orientation of the respondents. The accumulation and growth of contradictions in the perception of values between people of different professional orientations constitutes an urgent social problem of stratification in a digital society. The hypothesis was that the nature of involvement in the information process will have a diverse effect on the nature of shifts in the perception of the values of the digital society, which will reveal features of these shifts as caused by the specifics of professional training. The object of the study was the 3rd-year students of the Faculty of Journalism (96.7% of the general population) and the Faculty of Computer Technologies and Informatics (94.3%). The subject of the study is the peculiarities of the shift in the perception of digital information by students of the IT specialty in comparison with students of the humanities. The purpose of the study is to identify and study the shift in the perception of the values of the digital society among students of IT specialties as caused by the peculiarities of professional training. The results of the study revealed relevant characteristics of the shift in the perception of the values among students of IT specialties: firstly, the shift in the values of the digital society in comparison with the values of past years; secondly, a number of different stages in the formation of such a shift; thirdly, the separation of understanding of “companionship” and “communication”; fourthly, the peculiarities of the perception of IT tools rather as a means (for journalists) and as a goal of activity (for IT specialists); fifthly, the presence of a set of shifts in understanding the importance of such characteristics of IT activities as ethics, responsibility, accessibility, security and a number of others; sixth, minor shifts in understanding the role of the IT space as a potential means of self-education, typical for students of both groups.

Methods: Questionnaire survey was carried out among students in a vocational college in Shandong Province by literature method and questionnaire survey method, and SPSS19.0 was used for data analysis. Results: (1) The vast majority of students (93.72%) had a clear criterion for understanding moral connotation, and female students were more objective, rational and accurate than male students ($\chi^{2}=19.162,\ \mathrm{P}=0.000 < 0.001$). (2) There is a certain cognitive bias in the understanding of social injustice, showing the coexistence of positive and negative confrontation, hope and compromise; some students think that social injustice “should be eliminated” (48.66%), while others think that social injustice “is an inevitable phenomenon and cannot be changed” (21.07%); some students thought that social injustice “can stimulate people and social progress” (28.1%), while others thought it “doesn't matter” (2.17%); and girls were more inclined to be fair, positive and just than boys ($\chi 2=11.878,\ \mathrm{P}=0.002 < 0.05$). (3) The vast majority of students (93.07%) can keep clear cognition; only a few students have perceptual and wrong cognition in the use of power tendency; and girls are more cautious and responsible than boys ($\chi^{2}=13.535,\, \mathrm{P}=0.004 < 0.05$). (4) In terms of moral accomplishment and behavior evaluation of college students, the overall situation is positive and rational, while a few are negative and pessimistic. And female students are more confident and positive than male students; in terms of judgments that affect moral quality and behavior, they were more objective and rational ($\chi^{2}=109.975, \mathrm{P}=0.000 < 0.001$); in terms of the understanding of “the overall moral decline of college students”, Student cadres of middle school students were higher than non-student cadres ($\chi^{2}=9.232, \mathrm{P}=0.026 < 0.05$) with “completely agree” and “somewhat agree”.

Exploring ethical decision-making in group settings with real-life case studies,"2021 IEEE International Symposium on Ethics in Engineering, Science and Technology (ETHICS)",,,10.1109/ETHICS53270.2021.9632713,D. A. Martin; G. Bombaerts,2021,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9632713,IEEE Conferences,"Ethical decision-making has been recognised as an important goal of engineering ethics education. This goal has been formulated as enabling students to make decisions based on different ethical theories and frameworks [1], providing conceptual tools for students to recognize and counteract the potential threats of organizational practices [2], or helping students deal with ambiguity in decision-making situations [3]. EDMMs are a commonly taught theoretical base for ethical decision-making. Yet the focus has preponderantly been on students' responses to hypothetical, obvious and brief ethical dilemmas (vignettes), bracketing the group dimension or real features of the context of engineering practice [4]. This approach was shown to lead students to consider solely the perspective of the person making the decision, neglecting the stance of other stakeholders ([5], p.603). At the same time, studies exploring decision-making in STEM education group settings overlooked the ethical dimension of this process [6]. It is thus essential to introduce engineering students to ethical decision-making as situated practice [7], in a manner that can account for the complexities of real-life situations [8]. Our contribution examines students' emerging ethical decision-making process in a group setting when faced with a case (socio-technical problem) given by a stakeholder within their university's ecosystem. It is based on a Challenge-Based Learning course on Ethics and Data Analytics offered by a Dutch technological university in the spring of 2021. The research methods used are student interviews and document analysis of written assignments. The study aims to contribute to a better understanding of (i) how students move through the different steps of the decision-making process of finding an ethical solution to a real-life case, (ii) how they consider different stakeholder perspectives, (iii) the criteria and values guiding their decision-making, and (iv) how having a real case affects their view on the role of ethics in engineering decision-making. Bringing these processes to the forefront can guide engineering instructors in structuring the learning components of their course as to better support students' ethical reasoning. The study thus contributes to the limited body of evidence on how students engage in ethical decision-making in real-life contexts [9] and of the factors considered (Atesh et al., 2017).",ethical decision-making;challenge based learning;industry projects;case studies;qualitative research,"TU Eindhoven, Eindhoven, The Netherlands; TU Eindhoven, Eindhoven, The Netherlands",9 Dec 2021,,,1,1,,978-1-6654-0801-1,,Ethics;Decision making;Stakeholders;Engineering students;Tools;Springs;STEM,computer science education;data analysis;decision making;educational courses;engineering education;ethical aspects;STEM,ethical decision-making;engineering decision-making;support students;engineering ethics education;decision-making situations;ethical theories;STEM education;challenge-based learning course;data analytics;Dutch technological university;ethical reasoning,,2,,IEEE,9 Dec 2021,IEEE
Privacy is a feminist issue: Reconsidering data sharing in menstrual self-tracking apps,"2021 IEEE International Symposium on Ethics in Engineering, Science and Technology (ETHICS)",,,10.1109/ETHICS53270.2021.9632745,A. Fabricius,2021,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9632745,IEEE Conferences,"Though data governance, regulation and privacy are thought to be at the centre of a just society [1], feminist scholars have pointed out that privacy has historically been “a right not granted equally to all” [2, p. 1450]. Indeed, recent work has sought to identify how marginalized groups are especially prone to invasions of privacy, including having their private information used without their knowledge or consent in ways that can sustain and/or exacerbate social inequities [3],[4],[5]. In this presentation, I explore how the unethical data sharing practices of menstrual self-tracking apps like Flo and Ovia contribute to these problems. Flo prods users to log sensitive health data with explicit promises to “keep personal information private and secure” [6], though the Wall Street Journal demonstrated in 2019 that the company secretly shared user data with corporations for years [7]. Similarly, Ovia shared data with users' employers [8]. The consequences of these actions are complex, ranging from undermining users' health and well-being to potentially contributing to gender gaps in employment opportunities, pay, and access to resources. While there are benefits associated with using menstrual self-tracking apps, they can only be fully realized when these technologies are designed and operated ethically. I explore one possible path to improved corporate social responsibility by outlining the importance of developing theoretically informed corporate privacy policies that keep marginalized users' data private and secure. Drawing on insights from Nissenbaum's [9] theory of contextual integrity and feminist approaches to privacy that trouble the public/private dichotomy and the liberal democratic notion of a sovereign individual [10], [11], I explore what menstrual self-tracking apps could look like in the future, ultimately arguing that privacy is a feminist issue.",menstrual self-tracking apps;privacy;ethics;data sharing;corporate responsibility;feminism,"Psychology Department, University of Guelph, Guelph, Canada",9 Dec 2021,,,1,1,,978-1-6654-0801-1,,Gender issues;Data privacy;Privacy;Ethics;Surveillance;Social networking (online);Regulation,corporate social responsibility;data privacy;ethical aspects;gender issues;mobile computing,feminist issue;menstrual self-tracking apps;feminist scholars;unethical data;sensitive health data;user data;improved corporate social responsibility;theoretically informed corporate privacy policies;Flo;Ovia;marginalized users data,,,,IEEE,9 Dec 2021,IEEE

FMEAs are effective in preemptively identifying and addressing how a device or process might fail in operation and are often used in the design of high-risk technology applications such as military, automotive industry and medical devices. In this work, we explore whether FMEAs can serve as a risk assessment tool for machine learning practitioners, especially in deploying systems for high-risk applications (e.g. algorithms for recidivism assessment). In particular, we discuss how FMEAs can be used to identify social and ethical failures of Artificial Intelligent Systemss (AISs), recognizing that FMEAs have the potential to uncover a broader range of failures. We first propose a process for developing a Social FMEAs (So-FMEAs) by building on the existing FMEAs framework and a recently published definition of Social Failure Modes by Millar. We then demonstrate a simple proof-of-concept, So-FMEAs for the COMPAS algorithm, a risk assessment tool used by judges to make recidivism-related decisions for convicted individuals. Through this preliminary investigation, we illustrate how a traditional engineering risk management tool could be adapted for analyzing social and ethical failures of AIS.

Input, processing, and output are the different ethically relevant stages under which a spoken item or a speech navigates within the range of speech-processing modules. Employing the illocutionary force-content distinction, we specify and characterize the input-related ethical issues, the output-related ethical issues, and the processing-related ethical issues involved in speech processing. Together with illocutionary force-content distinction, we employ the data-information distinction to characterize the stage-wise ethical issues in the phenomenon of speech processing as the ethics of collecting (speech) data, the ethics of contextualizing (speech) data/information, and the ethics of releasing the con-textualized information (processed speech).

Tempering Transparency in Human-Robot Interaction,"2023 IEEE International Symposium on Ethics in Engineering, Science, and Technology (ETHICS)",,,10.1109/ETHICS57328.2023.10154942,K. Rogers; A. Howard,2023,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10154942,IEEE Conferences,"In recent years, particular interest has been taken by researchers and governments in examining and regulating aspects of transparency and explainability within artificially intelligent (AI) system. An AI system is “transparent” if humans can understand the mechanisms behind its behavior and use this understanding to make predictions about future behavior while the goal of explainable AI is to clarify an AI system's actions in a way that humans can understand. With this increased interest, research has presented conflicting views on the benefits of algorithmic transparency and explanations [1]. Moreover, research has also highlighted flaws within policy implementations of algorithmic transparency which generally remain too vague and often results in deficient adoption [2]. Even with these pitfalls of transparency, it seems as if the default view of many societies is that AI systems should be made more transparent and explainable; however, we argue that there needs to exist added skepticism of this position. In particular, we believe it is a useful exercise to consider exploring, as a counternarrative, an emerging area within computing that necessitates a lack of transparency-deceptive AI. The newly evolving area of research pertains to the creation (intentionally or not) of AI agents that learn to deceive humans and other AI agents. Here we define deception as “the process by which actions are chosen to manipulate beliefs so as to take advantage of the erroneous inferences” [3] and we use this interchangeably with “lying”. While there may be physically designed aspects of deception in embodied agents, such as the anthropomorphism and zoomorphism of robots [4], [5], here we wish to focus on deception related to utterances and actions of AI agents. On its surface, the idea of deceptive AI agents may not readily seem beneficial; however, there exists added effort to create AI agents that are able to be integrated socially within our societies. Seeing as deception is a foundational part of many human and animal groups, some argue that giving AI agents the ability to learn to deceive is necessary and inevitable for them to truly interact effectively [6], [7]. In fact, it has been found that deception can be an emergent behavior when training systems on human data [8]-thus strengthening the notion that behaving deceptively is a part of what it means to interact with humans. Moreover, prior research has shown that AI deception, rather than transparent truthfulness, can lead to better outcomes in human-robot interactions [9]–[11]. However, deception does of course have obvious drawbacks including an erosion of trust [12]–[15] and decreasing desired reutilization [12], [15]. Because of these negative aspects, and the clear possibly of malicious usage, some suggest the need for entirely truthful agents [16]. However, due to the infancy and lack of knowledge of the effects (short and long term) of deception within human-AI agent interaction, it is currently not possible to definitively determine the lasting implications of either encouraging or banning the practice. Given that transparency and explainability are in contention with deception, while also neither of the ideas are entirely beneficial nor detrimental, this presents important nuance when determining ethical and regulatory considerations of how AI agents should behave [17]. As such, the goal of this work is to present AI deception as a counternarrative to balance transparency and explainability with other considerations to spur discussions on how to be proactive, rather than reactive, to unforeseen consequences of our choices when designing AI systems that interact with humans.",deception;transparency;explainability;artificial intelligence;robotics;HRI,"Georgia Institute of Technology College of Computing, Atlanta, GA, USA; The Ohio State University College of Engineering, Columbus, OH, USA",23 Jun 2023,,,1,2,,978-1-6654-5713-2,,Training;Ethics;Animals;Government;Human-robot interaction;Prediction algorithms;Behavioral sciences,artificial intelligence;ethical aspects;explanation;human factors;human-robot interaction;social aspects of automation,AI deception;AI system;algorithmic transparency;artificially intelligent system;explainable AI;human-AI agent interaction;human-robot interaction;tempering transparency;transparency-deceptive AI,,,17,IEEE,23 Jun 2023,IEEE

J. Wiese; D. S. Schiff; A. J. Magana,2023,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10154947,IEEE Conferences,"Background: Questions surrounding the ethics of artificial intelligence (AI) have been debated for decades [1]. However, in recent years there have been multiple initiatives, scholarly reviews, and policy documents to identify and define ethical issues in play [2]. The efforts to bring high-level principles to applicable practice are complex and can be lost in translation [3]. Moreover, a call to be proactive, rather than reactive, stems from a deduction of intentions behind responsible innovation, value-centric design principles, education efforts, and representative data management techniques. Contemporary applications of AI are complex and difficult to explain, edit, and deal with once integrated in a natural system [4] [5]. Therefore, the analysis conducted within this systematic literature review (SLR) will clarify methods to promote and engage practice on the front end of ethical and responsible AI. As such, the research question is explored: How does each helix in the Quintuple Innovation model address responsible and ethical AI technology with anticipatory or proactive approaches? Methods: To conduct this ongoing research, an adaptation of the PRISMA framework and Hess & Fore's 2017 methodological approach guides the SLR [6] [7]. We included journal articles that were written in English and published between 2018-2023. The collected studies aim to examine how academic scholarship approaches to responsible AI within academia, government, industry, civil society, or the natural environment (the Quintuple Helix). The Web of Science, Google Scholar, and PhilPapers databases were used to identify a set of prominent publications in this field: AI & Society, Nature Machine Intelligence, Minds and Machines, IEEE Transactions on Technology and Society, AI and Ethics, Science and Engineering Ethics, and Communications of the ACM. A key limitation of this study is that it cannot gather the entirety of literature written about the topics of proactively promoting ethical AI due to the vast size and definitional complexity of the associated fields. These inclusion criteria allow the researchers to manage the data and draw meaningful insights from the most current thinking that is reflected in the rapid development of AI innovation we see today. Results and discussion: This poster will present preliminary results and the theoretical framework that guided the qualitative coding process. Additionally, this poster will serve as a forum to collect experts' opinions about what they would like to see from this SLR dataset, and how we can incorporate those elements into our coding. As a result, this data will be able to inform future work to investigate multiple gaps in the literature. For instance, U.S. Government work not protected by U.S. copyright this study will result in a theoretical framework that identifies proactive approaches to responsible and sustainable AI aligned with the five sectors for innovation. Inspired from [8], the effects of investments in education, and other sectors, will be mapped as a chain of responsible AI innovation across all innovation sectors. Finally, we can draw informed conclusions about the use and misuse of experts in AI, ethics, education, and policy. By working towards these objectives, we can see how the interdisciplinary field has made (or not made) a collective effort toward promoting responsible AI-filling a gap in the literature that highlights proactive approaches, rather than reactive.

Then, we validate our model by applying it to some recent healthrelated blockchain frameworks, and we compare a qualitative ethical assessment with the quantitative assessment made with the proposed model for constitutive ethics compliance.

However, when it comes to culture and creativity, many social and political cost factors should be taken into account. It is crucial to identify the opportunities that AI can offer in terms of the preservation, use, promotion, and accessibility of Cultural Heritage (CH). However, ethical concerns should be outlined when applying AI in cultural settings, such as for the digital replica of official UNESCO heritage sites or an unbiased explanation and interpretation of a work of art. This paper provides a first attempt to define the main ethical findings on this topic and propose it as an ethical framework to assess different risks arising from the use of AI in the CH domain. The application of this disruptive technology in the arts is evaluated through the lens of ethical principles for trustworthy AI and it explores whether the wider accessibility and improved preservation techniques enabled by AI come at some cost in terms of interpretation, social and cultural inclusion, subjectivism, or other forms of bias. The main ethical principles that emerge from the literature for the application of AI in the cultural domain are the following: Shared Responsibility, Meaningful Participation, Explainability, Accessibility, Sustainability, Reliability and Dignity.

What Is a Subliminal Technique?

One aspect of this concern relates to the use of AI systems for problematically manipulative influence. In response to this, the European Union's draft AI Act (AIA) includes a prohibition on AI systems deploying subliminal techniques that alter people's behavior in ways that are reasonably likely to cause harm (Article 5(1)(a)). Critics have argued that the term ‘subliminal techniques’ is too narrow to capture the target cases of AI-based manipulation. We propose a definition of ‘subliminal techniques’ that (a) is grounded on a plausible interpretation of the legal text; (b) addresses all or most of the underlying ethical concerns motivating the prohibition; (c) is defensible from a scientific and philosophical perspective; and (d) does not over-reach in ways that impose excessive administrative and regulatory burdens.

‘Emerging proxies’ in information-rich machine learning: a threat to fairness?,"2023 IEEE International Symposium on Ethics in Engineering, Science, and Technology (ETHICS)",,,10.1109/ETHICS57328.2023.10155045,A. J. McLoughney; J. M. Paterson; M. Cheong; A. Wirth,2023,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10155045,IEEE Conferences,"Anti-discrimination law in many jurisdictions effectively bans the use of race and gender in automated decision-making. For example, this law means that insurance companies should not explicitly ask about legally protected attributes, e.g., race, in order to tailor their premiums to particular customers. In legal terms, indirect discrimination occurs when a generally neutral rule or variable is used, but significantly negatively affects one demographic group. An emerging example of this concern is inclusion of proxy variables in Machine Learning (ML) models, where neutral variables are predictive of protected attributes. For example, postcodes or zip codes are representative of communities, and therefore racial demographics and social-economic class; i.e., a traditional example of ‘redlining’ pre-dating modern automated techniques [1]. The law struggles with proxy variables in machine learning: indirect discrimination cases are difficult to bring to court, particularly because finding substantial evidence that shows the indirect discrimination to be unlawful is difficult [2]. With more complex machine-learning models being developed for automated decision making, e.g., random forests or state-of-the-art deep neural networks, more data points on customers are accumulated [1], from a wide variety of sources. With such rich data, ML models can produce multiple interconnected correlations - such as that found in single neurons in a neural network, or single decision trees in a random forest - which are predictive of protected attributes, akin to traditional uses of discrete proxy variables. In this poster, we introduce the concept of ""emerging proxies"", that are a combination of several variables, from which the ML model could infer the protected attribute(s) of the individuals in the dataset. This concept differs from the traditional concept of proxies because rather than addressing a single proxy variable, a distribution of interconnected proxies would have to be addressed. Our contribution is to provide evidence for the capacity of complex ML models to identify protected attributes through the correlation of other variables. This correlation is not made explicitly through a discrete one to one relationship between variables, but through a many-to-one relationship. This contribution complements concerns raised in legal analyses of automated decision-making about proxies in ML models leading to indirect discrimination [3]. Our contribution shows that if an ML model contains “emerging proxies” for a protected attribute, the distribution of proxies will be a roadblock when attempting to de-bias the model, limiting the pathways available for addressing potential discrimination caused by the ML model.",algorithmic fairness;proxies;discrimination;consumer law;credit,"Centre of AI and Digital Ethics/Faculty of Engineering and IT, The University of Melbourne, Melbourne, Australia; Centre of AI and Digital Ethics/Faculty of Law, The University of Melbourne, Melbourne, Australia; Faculty of Engineering and IT, School of Computing and Information Systems, The University of Melbourne, Melbourne, Australia; Faculty of Engineering and IT, School of Computing and Information Systems, The University of Melbourne, Melbourne, Australia",23 Jun 2023,,,1,1,,978-1-6654-5713-2,,Law;Ethics;Australia;Decision making;Correlation;Random forests;Predictive models,decision making;decision trees;deep learning (artificial intelligence);learning (artificial intelligence);legislation;random forests,anti-discrimination law;automated decision making;automated decision-making;complex machine-learning models;complex ML models;discrete proxy variables;emerging example;emerging proxies;generally neutral rule;indirect discrimination cases;information-rich machine learning;interconnected proxies;ML model;neutral variables;particular customers;potential discrimination;protected attribute;random forests;redlining pre-dating modern automated techniques;single decision trees;single proxy variable;traditional example,,,,IEEE,23 Jun 2023,IEEE

Perceptions of AI Ethics on Social Media,"2023 IEEE International Symposium on Ethics in Engineering, Science, and Technology (ETHICS)",,,10.1109/ETHICS57328.2023.10155069,A. Ocal,2023,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10155069,IEEE Conferences,"Since the emergence of Artificial intelligence (AI), despite a common expectation that AI should be ‘ethical’ [1], there are many different interpretations, assumptions, and expectations about what constitutes ""ethical AI"" and which ethical problems and requirements are pointed out by the public. Even though many private companies and research institutions have highlighted present and possible future problems, needs, and guidelines associated with AI ethics, relevant public visions regarding how ""ethical AI"" can be constituted [1] have not been explored sufficiently. For obtaining public opinions, although questionnaires and interviews are commonly used, the questions in these methods are designed based on only the researchers' preferences, and this could be a limitation. Social media data, however, are produced by users freely [2], and many people share their ideas in social media discussions [3]. Social media data usage, therefore, has been growing in various research studies. Researchers intending to utilize social media as a data source predominantly harness Twitter data, yet in recent years Reddit has also gained the attention of scholars with the same research purpose, as in [2], [3]. Reddit is a huge social media platform involving over 50 million daily active users with diverse mentalities shaped by different backgrounds, prior beliefs, personal experiences, and personalities, from various geographical locations, and 100 thousand active communities, thereby it brings different segments of the public together. Moreover, users benefit from a level of anonymity on Reddit not typically accomplished on other social media platforms [4], thereby users may feel more secure and share more honest thoughts on a topic, thus the Reddit data have been used to gather public opinions in prior research as in [3]. Through the lens of technological frames [5], to explore social media users' interpretations, assumptions, and expectations about how ethical AI is built, and which problems hinder building ethical AI, Reddit conversations were analyzed. More specifically, a corpus consisting of 998 unique Reddit post titles and their corresponding 16611 comments extracted from 15 AI-related subreddits were identified by using topic modelling supported by human judgment for frame identification as in [6] based on BERTopic [7]. The findings show that perceptions about AI ethics are clustered around several themes (AI's gender bias; humans' gender bias about perceived gender of bots; regulation and patent laws related to AI use; AI spreading disinformation; AI making fake faces, videos, music; misuse of personal data; and AI impact on crime), with deviations about how these themes are interpreted, what problems or actors they pertain to, and what appropriate measures should be taken to address problems pointed out by the public. While some of these ethical issues were also highlighted in prominent AI ethics literature as in [8], the findings of this study indicated new insights such as humans' gender bias about the perceived gender of bots. The findings offer important implications. First, as a practical implication, the findings can enrich current public voice-centric explorations of AI ethics. Also, they could help designing suitable interfaces that allow proper human-AI task coordination and collaboration and deploying innovative solutions for existing or anticipated ethical problems. Second, expected outcomes can demonstrate areas where misconceptions and unrealistic visions about AI ethics are widespread, which may trigger speculative fears or concerns. Researchers may be encouraged to more focus on the areas where public misconceptions are more common; educational programs may be arranged to reduce speculative fears or concerns or take necessary measures for real ethical risks. Academia, industry and government communities may collaborate for research and policy arrangements in those areas. Third, through employing computeraided textual analysis, this study reveals frames in social media conversations to showcase the latest perceptions from different viewpoints. This method may be an example method for relevant future research.",AI ethics;social media;Reddit;public perceptions;technological frames;bias,"Information Science and Technology, Syracuse University, Syracuse,, NY",23 Jun 2023,,,1,1,,978-1-6654-5713-2,,Social networking (online);Ethics;Artificial intelligence;Oral communication;Media;Guidelines;Chatbots,artificial intelligence;chatbots;ethical aspects;Internet;natural language processing;patents;sentiment analysis;social networking (online),AI impact;AI spreading disinformation;AI's gender bias;AI-related subreddits;ethical AI;existing anticipated ethical problems;huge social media platform;human-AI task coordination;prominent AI ethics literature;public opinions;social media conversations;social media data usage;social media discussions;social media platforms;social media users,,,,IEEE,23 Jun 2023,IEEE

However, it is unclear to what degree the proposed efforts have been or will be effective in practice. The question remains whether these incremental, multi-stakeholder AI ethics efforts are in fact trying to address a fundamentally systemic issue inherent to the existing corporate power structure. As an attempt to address this question, we gain an understanding of the major themes in high profile AI-related catastrophes in the last four years (2018–2021) through an inductive media analysis. We then investigate how the principle of democratic gov-ernance and distributive executive power - core to co-operative organization structure - could have prevented or mitigated the contributing factors of the reported events. We find that the vast majority (71%) of the recent AI ethics scandals are not the result of a lack of knowledge or tools, but attributed to power dynamics that hinder the ability of internal stakeholders from taking action.

Considering the importance and the widespread practice of consent-obtaining in different domains, critical and interdisciplinary studies of the current consent-obtaining mechanisms are highly needed. In this paper, we first shortly discuss an interdisciplinary human-centric perspective to consenting and propose that, among others, the contextuality of consent, as well as the potential intersectionality of consent, should be carefully considered in the development of consent-obtaining mechanisms. Then we elaborate on the distinction between “consent to personal data processing for commercial purposes” and “consent to personal data donations intended for research” in the field of direct-to-consumer genetic testing (DTC-GT). We show that based on our human-centric perspective, the contextuality and intersectionality of consent are sometimes overlooked in the current DTC-GT services, which are of considerable significance in the emerging genetic data markets.

An overarching goal of our team’s larger project is to examine the effects of culture and education on ethics training in undergraduate engineering students at universities in the United States, China, and the Netherlands to assess how this training impacts students’ ethical reasoning and moral dispositions, and how this differs cross-culturally. To gauge students’ moral dispositions and ethical reasoning skills and to measure any change in these, we administer the Moral Foundations Questionnaire and the Engineering & Science Issues Test to engineering students longitudinally over four years. Because the conditions related to engineering ethics education differ widely per participating institution, interpreting and analyzing survey quantitative data will require understanding the contextual conditions of education at each institution. In this paper we ask the question what and how can case study methods contribute to longitudinal and cross-cultural ethics educational research with large data sets? To answer it, we develop conceptual and methodological foundations for the design of comparative, multi-institutional case studies to contextualize, complement, and interpret quantitative and qualitative data on ethical reasoning and moral dispositions. We develop comparative case studies to supply missing contextual information for triangulation with quantitative and qualitative data and to provide a more complete picture of the engineering ethics educational contexts, strategies, and practices at each of the participating universities. In this project, case studies provide informational and contextual significance to the other sources of data our research produces, elucidating conditions required to understand and make sense of the results of the research. In the paper we introduce our research project, motivate the use of case studies in our research by reviewing literature on case studies and multi-method triangulation in educational research. We explain how specific cases will be designed, and by providing the first step of two cases, timelines of ethics interventions for two degree programs, demonstrate the informational and interpretive need for comparative case studies in triangulating with other data sources.

TEDS is presented as an integrative and innovative approach committed to an interdisciplinary perspective. Thereby, TEDS reflects all social areas of the human lifeworld in their ethical scope. With recourse to phenomenological methods, TEDS helps to address ethical implications which arise from deep interference of autonomous systems with the human lifeworld. The meaning of intentional structures and the problem of appresentations in the phenomenological sense still represents a blank gap in the current ethical discourse on the problem of data breaches. The findings provide methods for dealing with ethical challenges and explain the problem area of an appropriate technoethical use in the lifeworld. In this way, problems can already be avoided in the development process of artificial intelligence systems and their applications by specifically searching for blind spots in a technical and ethical manner. Furthermore, this approach helps to assure a technoethical use of autonomous systems in an appropriate way and ultimately leads to a limitation of damages – which may occur in case of malfunctions and data breaches of artificial intelligence systems – in the lifeworld of humans.

We propose an online reinforcement learning method that learns a policy under the constraint that the agent should not be the cause of harm. This is accomplished by defining cause using the theory of actual causation and assigning blame to the agent when its actions are the actual cause of an undesirable outcome. We conduct experiments on a toy ethical dilemma in which a natural choice of reward function leads to clearly undesirable behavior, but our method learns a policy that avoids being the cause of harmful behavior, demonstrating the soundness of our approach.

This research examines both current attempts at governance and common concerns to address using both a case study on Amazon’s Alexa and a previously conducted survey of U.S. public opinion on AI. The results of these studies show that AI is not necessarily always secure and that citizens’ concerns over AI risks are growing. Overall, this research highlights some of the key areas governing bodies should seek to address.",artificial intelligence;AI;governance;security;public opinion;survey;case study,"Department of Business Administration, Epoka University, Tirana, Albania; Department of Business Administration, Epoka University, Tirana, Albania",7 Sep 2022,,,104,111,,978-1-6654-8980-5,,Privacy;Ethics;Law;Virtual assistants;Minimization;Security;Artificial intelligence,artificial intelligence;globalisation;government data processing;security of data,artificial intelligence governance;ethical security issues;AI risks,,,29,IEEE,7 Sep 2022,IEEE

All this data collected by the smart devices results in Big Data. When it comes to handling big data, safeguarding this sensitive data from hackers and cyber bullies is a difficult task. Apart from this, Big Data collection also gives rise to some serious ethical and legal issues. While in most countries there are now laws to deal with these issues, it is still a complicated task to tackle these cyber activities as they are not governed geographically.

In European Union, the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) has been enforced since 2018, aiming to protect a person's privacy. However, the growth of the data economy might be hindered due to the lack of a trusted, secure and privacy-aware tool. Motivated by this observation, this work presents Data Vaults - a secure, distributed and privacy-preserving personal data management platform. The main goal is to mitigate various privacy concerns through allowing an individual to maintain the ownership, handle and share the data based on their willingness. The platform enables a flexible data sharing method with fair compensation schemes. In particular, with the Data Vaults platform, an individual can protect the sharing of personal data and fairly define how value can be captured, created, released and cashed out for the benefit of all the stakeholders involved (companies or not).",Data Management;GDPR;Blockchain;Cloud;Personal Data;User Privacy,"Department of Applied Mathematics and Computer Science, SPTAGE Lab, Technical University of Denmark, Denmark; Department of Applied Mathematics and Computer Science, SPTAGE Lab, Technical University of Denmark, Denmark",11 Oct 2023,,,1,4,2575-8411,979-8-3503-3986-4,,Data privacy;Ethics;Distributed databases;Europe;Companies;Stakeholders;General Data Protection Regulation,blockchains;data handling;data protection;distributed processing;law;trusted computing,blockchain;data economy;data handling;data privacy;data vaults;distributed personal data management platform;general data protection regulation;personal data protection;personal data sharing;privacy-aware tool;privacy-preserving personal data management platform;secure personal data management platform;secure-aware tool;trusted-aware tool;user privacy,,,12,IEEE,11 Oct 2023,IEEE

With the widespread adoption of decision making systems also in very sensitive environments, fairness has become a very important topic of discussion within the data science community. In this context, it is crucial to ensure that the data on which we base these decisions, are fair, and do not reflect historical biases. In this demo, we propose FAIR-DB (FunctionAl dependencIes to discoveR Data Bias), a system that exploiting the notion of Functional Dependency, a particular type of constraint on the data, can discover unethical behaviours in a dataset. The proposed solution is implemented as a web-based application, that, given an input dataset, generates such dependencies, walks the user trough their analysis, and finally provides many insights about bias present in the data. Our tool uses a novel metric to evaluate the unfairness present in datasets, identifies the attributes that encompass discrimination (e.g. ethnicity, sex or religion), and provides very precise information about the groups treated unequally. We also provide a detailed description of the system architecture and present a demonstration scenario, based on a real-world dataset frequently used in the field of computer ethics.",Fairness;Functional Dependencies;Data Bias,"Dip.

We want to take an approach for mitigating such bias based on the idea of data segmentation, that is, dividing data into segments where people should be treated similarly. Such an approach should be useful in the sense that the mitigation process itself is explainable for cases that similar people should be treated similarly. Although research on such cases exists, the question of effectiveness of data segmentation itself, however, remains to be answered. In this paper, we answer this question by empirically analyzing the experimental results of data segmentation by using two datasets, i.e., the UCI Adult dataset and the Kaggle ‘Give me some credit’ (gmsc) dataset. We empirically show that (1) fairness can be controllable during training models by the way of dividing data into segments; more specifically, by selecting the attributes and setting the number of segments for adjusting statistics such as statistical parity of the segments and mutual information between the attributes, etc. (2) the effects of data segmentation is dependent on classifiers, and (3) there exist weak trade-offs between fairness and accuracy with regard to data segmentation.",fairness;machine learning;data segmentation;empirical analysis,"Research Center for AI Ethics Fujitsu Limited, Kawasaki, Japan; Research Center for AI Ethics Fujitsu Limited, Kawasaki, Japan",8 Feb 2023,,,155,162,2375-9259,979-8-3503-4609-1,,Training;Conferences;Machine learning;Data models;Data mining;Mutual information,learning (artificial intelligence);pattern classification;statistical analysis,fairness-aware data segmentation;mitigating bias;similar people,,,33,IEEE,8 Feb 2023,IEEE
Learning About People's Attitude Towards Food Available in India and Its Implications for Fair AI-based Systems,2022 IEEE International Conference on Data Mining Workshops (ICDMW),,,10.1109/ICDMW58026.2022.00128,H.

With food being essential to human survival and core to any economy, the domain has attracted a number of Artificial Intelligence (AI) techniques applied to tasks like food recommendation, recipe creation and food-oriented wellness. We want to explore if such concerns of fairness are appropriate here since food choices have an impact on an individual's health, personal finance and other aspects of life, and thus, any AI introduced here should be responsibly evaluated for not only performance but also non-functional requirements like their impact on users. As a first step towards that goal, in this paper, we want to understand people's perception towards food with respect to their background, and use this as the context to evaluate food-based AI systems in future. Therefore, we conduct the first-of-its-kind survey on perception about food available in India at educational institutes from participants who may associate themselves with different regions within and outside India. We find that users have unequal access to food from different regions today and this may be considered unfair by existing group fairness definitions. Further, we find that many food choices transcend regions, a majority of people prefer food outside their own regions and that usage of digital tools for food is on the rise. The results suggest that AI developers can provide broader and fairer (equal) access by using a mixed strategy of food choices that transcend regions (exploit food data) and also choosing new choices that are region-specific (explore food) dependent on user's regional association.",Applied Data Science (DS);Ethical Issues in DS Applications;Food;Survey;AI Implications,"Department of Computer Sc. and Engg., lIT Roorkee; Department of Computer Sc. and Engg., lIT Roorkee; AI Institute, University of South Carolina; Dept. of Humanities and Social Sciences, lIT Roorkee",8 Feb 2023,,,985,992,2375-9259,979-8-3503-4609-1,,Ethics;Conferences;Finance;Data science;Data mining;Artificial intelligence;Task analysis,artificial intelligence;behavioural sciences computing;ethical aspects,artificial intelligence techniques;fair AI-based systems;food choices;food data;food recommendation;food-based AI systems;India,,,17,IEEE,8 Feb 2023,IEEE

Reaction times (RTs) and electroencephalography (delta, theta, beta, alpha, gamma bands) data were also gathered. Data showed that participants apply different moral rules based on the agent factor, considering humans more moral, responsible, and conscious. The evaluation of the emotional impact derived from human actions was perceived as more severe. Moreover, increased gamma power was found when assessing the intentionality and emotional impact of machines. Higher beta power in the right frontal and frontocentral areas was detected when evaluating the machine's produced emotional impact. An increased right temporal activation was detected when evaluating human agent's emotional impact.

Apart from the conventional e-gov and e-dem systems, virtual worlds (social media or other forms of online systems) become increasingly used as tools for promoting (or suppressing) democratic values and calls for changes. There is significant research on designing more efficient systems for practising e-democracy and (digital) ethics [1] [2]. However, fewer examples exist when it comes to mechanisms capable of managing democratic and ethical values in neutral digital systems whose main purpose is not related to e-gov and e-dem [3]. Together with a large stratum of society, power structures also migrate to virtual worlds. Therefore, there is a strong need to successfully migrate and enable democratic and ethical principles - one of the oldest and the most important values of a society.We propose a paradigm shift in system design to make online systems more transparent and open to external evaluation by neutral domain experts and institutions through visual workflows and behavioral processes. One implementation of such an approach is the ColaboFlow workflow framework, together with an associated domain-specific framework - Democracy Framework. We argue for the benefits of such an approach especially in the face-to-virtual context, which has become the primary modus operandi for many community-related events during the COVID- 19 era. We demonstrate ColaboFlow and Democracy in the real context of Wikipedia by analyzing its community and users, i.e. knowledge workers, and their behavior. We analyze and evaluate the Wikipedia community’s engagement (motivation) and participation in collaborative work in the relationship in terms of democratic and ethical community behaviors. We observe the types and quantities of the Wikipedia policies that knowledge workers refer to in the process of deliberative democracy, and correlate these findings with user behavior and motivation for contributing within the online ecosystem.

To do this, the model taken as a reference is the one implemented by the Property Registry of the Pedro Moncayo Canton (PRPMC), Pichincha Province, Ecuador which due to its operability in the management of public data, brought about the achievement of said ISO international seal on Information Security and therefore became a benchmark for good practices in Ecuador at a national level. A quantitative methodology was used to analyze the design of the ISMS adopted by the PRPMC, under the international standard ISO/IEC 27001:2013 with the integration of some national regulations issued by the different competent control bodies. When a model is implemented, it can be considered that it indisputably ensures public data at a good level and allows us to be prepared through a contingency plan in the face of any adversity that implies damage or loss of physical or digital information and therefore be able to continue operating. In the same way, through the Gray Box-type ethical hacking reports, the evolution of the security and vulnerabilities of public data allocated at servers and in the cloud is shown.

The basic idea is that you can tell what it takes to count as a good person of a particular type in a particular community by seeing how persons of that type are described and celebrated in their obituaries. Obituaries of those killed in conflict, in particular, are rich repositories of communal values, as they reflect the values and virtues that are admired and respected in individuals who are considered to be heroes in their communities. In this paper, we use natural language processing techniques to map the patterns of values and virtues attributed to Australian military personnel who were killed in action during World War I and World War II.

However, it is still unclear how this is to be implemented in practice for specific classes of algorithms—such as motion planners. In this paper we unpack the concept of explanation in the context of motion planning, introducing a new taxonomy of kinds and purposes of explanations in this context.

At the same time, a consistent evolution of smartphone cameras has led to a photography explosion with 85% of all new pictures being captured using smartphones. However, lately, there has been an increased discussion of privacy concerns when a person being photographed is unaware of the picture being taken or has reservations about the same being shared. These privacy violations are amplified for people with disabilities, who may find it challenging to raise dissent even if they are aware. Such unauthorized image captures may also be misused to gain sympathy by third-party organizations, leading to a privacy breach. Privacy for people with disabilities has so far received comparatively less attention from the AI community. This motivates us to work towards a solution to generate privacy-conscious cues for raising awareness in smartphone users of any sensitivity in their viewfinder content. To this end, we introduce PrivPAS (A real time Privacy-Preserving AI System) a novel framework to identify sensitive content. Additionally, we curate and annotate a dataset to identify and localize accessibility markers and classify whether an image is sensitive to a featured subject with a disability. We demonstrate that the proposed lightweight architecture, with a memory footprint of a mere 8.49MB, achieves a high mAP of 89.52% on resource-constrained devices.

As a result, data owners profit from this data, including personal information, sharing it with ethical third parties such as marketers. Unauthorized users can utilize data for unethical goals, resulting in various attacks and illicit uses of data. In this case, it is necessary to anonymize users' data before sharing it with others. Clustering users and anonymizing data set in a way that will not isolate individuals from the group.

However, implementing AI ethics in practice remains a challenge for organizations. Various guidelines have been published to aid companies in doing so, but these have not seen widespread adoption and may feel impractical. In this technical briefing, we discuss how to implement AI ethics. We showcase a method developed for this purpose, ECCOLA, which is based on academic research.

Recently, many of these datasets, e.g., MS-Celeb-1M and VGGFace2, are retracted due to credible privacy and ethical concerns. This motivates this work to propose and investigate the feasibility of using a privacy-friendly synthetically generated face dataset to train face recognition models. Towards this end, we utilize a class-conditional generative adversarial network to generate class-labeled synthetic face images, namely SFace. To address the privacy aspect of using such data to train a face recognition model, we provide extensive evaluation experiments on the identity relation between the synthetic dataset and the original authentic dataset used to train the generative model. Our reported evaluation proved that associating an identity of the authentic dataset to one with the same class label in the synthetic dataset is hardly possible. We also propose to train face recognition on our privacy-friendly dataset, SFace, using three different learning strategies, multi-class classification, label-free knowledge transfer, and combined learning of multi-class classification and knowledge transfer. The reported evaluation results on five authentic face benchmarks demonstrated that the privacy-friendly synthetic dataset has a high potential to be used for training face recognition models, achieving, for example, a verification accuracy of 91.87% on LFW using multi-class classification and 99.13% using the combined learning strategy.

Fairer Machine Learning Through the Hybrid of Multi-objective Evolutionary Learning and Adversarial Learning,2023 International Joint Conference on Neural Networks (IJCNN),,,10.1109/IJCNN54540.2023.10191821,S. Gui; Q. Zhang; C. Huang; B. Yuan,2023,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10191821,IEEE Conferences,"With growing concerns about the unwanted bias or discrimination in machine learning, a number of fairness-aware machine learning algorithms have been developed to mitigate bias in the prediction. Because the objectives of accuracy and fairness are antagonistic, it is hard to balance the trade-off between them. Recently, Multi-objective Evolutionary Learning (MOEL) framework has been proposed to train a set of Pareto models with the consideration of accuracy and fairness simultaneously. However, this framework prefers to train more accurate models rather than fairer models due to the lack of gradient in terms of fairness. In this paper, MOEL is enhanced through introducing Adversarial Learning (AL). The MOEL-AL framework aims to maximize a set of predictors' ability to predict true labels and minimize the ability of an adversarial network to predict the sensitive attributes from the predictors' output. Specifically, the adversarial network can be regarded as a proxy of the undifferentiable fairness metrics, so it is possible to propagate gradients in terms of both accuracy and fairness for the predictors during the back-propagation process. Besides, the adversarial strength for different predictors is adjusted dynamically according to their fairness metric. Compared with the state-of-the-art methods, experimental studies on seven well-known datasets show that our method can provide a set of fairer Pareto models with little drop on accuracy.",Fairness in machine learning;AI ethics;Adversarial learning;Multi-objective optimization,"Research Institute of Trustworthy Autonomous Systems (RITAS), Southern University of Science and Technology (SUSTech), Shenzhen, China; Research Institute of Trustworthy Autonomous Systems (RITAS), Southern University of Science and Technology (SUSTech), Shenzhen, China; Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Guangdong Provincial Key Laboratory of Brain-inspired Intelligent Computation, Southern University of Science and Technology (SUSTech), Shenzhen, China; Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Guangdong Provincial Key Laboratory of Brain-inspired Intelligent Computation, Southern University of Science and Technology (SUSTech), Shenzhen, China",2 Aug 2023,,,1,9,2161-4407,978-1-6654-8867-9,"National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61976111,62250710682); ",Measurement;Training;Ethics;Adaptation models;Machine learning algorithms;Sociology;Neural networks,data handling;evolutionary computation;learning (artificial intelligence);Pareto analysis,adversarial learning;adversarial network;back-propagation process;fairer machine;fairer Pareto models;fairness-aware machine learning algorithms;hybrid of multi-objective evolutionary learning;MOEL-AL framework;multiobjective evolutionary learning framework;undifferentiable fairness metrics;unwanted bias,,,32,IEEE,2 Aug 2023,IEEE

Based on the insight that mass data is sufficient and shares the same knowledge structure with non-mass data of identifying the malignancy of a lesion based on the ultrasound image, we propose a novel transfer learning framework to enhance the generalizability of the DNN model for non-mass BUS with the help of mass BUS. Specifically, we train a shared DNN with combined non-mass and mass data. With the prior of different marginal distributions in input and output space, we employ two domain alignment strategies in the proposed transfer learning framework with the insight of capturing domain-specific distribution to address the issue of domain shift. Moreover, we propose a cross-domain semantic-preserve data generation module called CrossMix to recover the missing distribution between non-mass and mass data that is not presented in training data.

Ethics of AI as practical ethics,2021 IEEE International Symposium on Technology and Society (ISTAS),,,10.1109/ISTAS52410.2021.9629163,F. Richter,2021,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9629163,IEEE Conferences,"Whereas we acknowledge in general certain values as crucial for the ethical debate in AI, like e.g., fairness, transparency, and accountability, these values often can stand in conflict with each other. E.g., more transparency can lead to less privacy. Introducing higher principles to balance the values faces two problematic issues: (1.) Principles also can stand in conflict with each other and defer the discussion into a purely theoretical realm. (2.) If a higher-level principle is introduced and this also stands in conflict with another principle, then a higher-higher-level principle is needed, and we will get into an infinite regress. Although ethics of AI is part of the so-called field of applied ethics and it seems therefore that it is about the application of principles and values and finding the right balance regarding certain ethical theories, e.g., Kantian ethics or utilitarianism ([1][2][3]), the traditional approaches in the field of applied ethics do not offer sufficient conceptual means to deal with practical problems. Thus, the problems that arise from the implementation of intelligent systems can also not be handled adequately, because the same issue as above arises: How can the values be balanced regarding the ethical theories? If higher-level principles are not a viable approach to resolve conflicts of values, the criteria under which they can be implemented should be taken into consideration. Therefore, it is proposed that specific criteria for the implementation of the values need to be made explicit, which will result at least in a clarification for the public debate about certain technological advancements in the field of AI.

“Resurrecting” dead celebrities: Editing and using remnant data of the deceased through AI,2022 IEEE International Symposium on Technology and Society (ISTAS),1,,10.1109/ISTAS55053.2022.10227098,A. Orita,2022,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10227098,IEEE Conferences,"This paper explores the public perception toward handling remnant data of a celebrity after their death. It attempts to compile or publish these data, aiming to “resurrect” the celebrity through virtual reality (VR) and artificial intelligence (AI). Although such data are used for the memorial of the deceased, their autonomy and privacy preferences regarding the handling of their data must be addressed. Moreover, businesses that use remnant data of the deceased are emerging. This paper presents the results of an online survey conducted with 1,200 participants. The results showed that the percentage of respondents who wanted to utilize the data was low, with most answering “neither” and “don’t know” to questions regarding handling of remnant data of the deceased. In the responses, clear differences were observed based on gender, religion, and age group, with those by respondents in their 20s and 40s being the most distinctive. The methods preferred by the respondents to utilize remnant data varied according to the circumstances of the death and not celebrity type. In the case of predicted deaths, respondents preferred to compile posthumous data, whereas in the case of suicides, they preferred not to resurrect the individual via AI or VR. This indicates that the demand to resurrect celebrities is currently low; however, this may change in the future, and the ethical aspects will need to be considered.",postmortem data;ethics;social survey;AI;resurrection,"College of Interhuman Symbiotic Studies, Kanto Gakuin University, Yokohama, Japan",28 Aug 2023,,,1,4,2158-3412,978-1-6654-8410-7,,Surveys;Data privacy;Virtual reality;Market research;Regression analysis;Artificial intelligence;Ethical aspects,artificial intelligence;data privacy;ethical aspects;human factors;humanities;virtual reality,AI;artificial intelligence;dead celebrity resurrection;posthumous data;remnant data handling;virtual reality;VR,,,15,IEEE,28 Aug 2023,IEEE

In this contribution, I argue that as information (eco)systems, social media sites are vulnerable from three aspects, each corresponding to the classical 3-tier architecture in information systems: asymmetric networks (data tier); algorithms powering the supposed personalisation for the user experience (application tier); and adverse or audacious design of the user experience and overall information ecosystem (presentation tier) - which can be summarised as the 3 A’s. Thus, the open question remains: how can we ‘fix’ social media?

These challenges have recently been raised by ethicists, computer scientists, and policymakers. More specifically, existing frameworks are encountering challenges such as the difficulties that come along with defining an AI, adapting to the needs of the public in participating in democratic governance, and considering the environmental impacts of these systems. After critically reviewing the three challenges, this paper proposes alternative regulatory approaches to address each of these regulatory challenges. To address the definition challenge, we propose a multidimensional approach to defining AI. We argue that a relational approach can be helpful for making visible the cultural context in which AI systems are embedded. Finally, we suggest that involving a systematic environmental studies approach in assessing AI is conducive to the development of not only more environmentally friendly AI systems but also AI technologies that can be used to address challenging global environmental issues.",ethical governance;artificial intelligence;regulation framework;AI regulation;AI ethics;ethical regulation,"Department of Computer Science, Colorado School of Mines, Golden, CO, USA; Department of Engineering Education, Virginia Tech, Blacksburg, VA, USA",28 Aug 2023,,,1,5,2158-3412,978-1-6654-8410-7,,Ethics;Systematics;Regulation;Reflection;Complexity theory;Cultural differences;Artificial intelligence,artificial intelligence;ethical aspects,AI technologies;alternative regulation approaches;alternative regulatory approaches;artificial intelligence;critical reflections;democratic governance;environmental impacts;environmentally friendly AI systems;ethical regulation;multidimensional approach;relational approach;systematic environmental studies approach,,,13,IEEE,28 Aug 2023,IEEE

US images can be used to measure abdominal muscles dimensions for the diagnosis and creation of customized treatment plans for patients with Low Back Pain (LBP), however, they are difficult to interpret. Due to high variability, skilled professionals with specialized training are required to take measurements to avoid low intra-observer reliability. This variability stems from the challenging nature of accurately finding the correct spatial location of measurement endpoints in abdominal US images. In this paper, we use a Deep Learning (DL) approach to automate the measurement of the abdominal muscle thickness in 2D US images. By treating the problem as a localization task, we develop a modified Fully Convolutional Network (FCN) architecture to generate blobs of coordinate locations of measurement endpoints, similar to what a human operator does. We demonstrate that using the TrA400 US image dataset, our network achieves a Mean Absolute Error (MAE) of 0.3125 on the test set, which almost matches the performance of skilled ultrasound technicians.

Our objective is to determine the potential of S-WAVE to classify breast tissue lesions as malignant or benign. We present a new processing pipeline for feature-based classification of breast cancer using S-WAVE data, and we evaluate it on a new data set collected from 40 patients. Novel bi-spectral and Wigner spectrum features are computed directly from the RF time series and are combined with textural and spectral features from B-mode and elasticity images. The Random Forest permutation importance ranking and the Quadratic Mutual Information methods are used to reduce the number of features from 377 to 20. Support Vector Machines and Random Forest classifiers are used with leave-one-patient-out and Monte Carlo cross-validations. Classification results obtained for different feature sets are presented. Our best results (95% confidence interval, Area Under Curve = 95%±1.45%, sensitivity = 95%, and specificity = 93%) outperform the state-of-the-art reported S-WAVE breast cancer classification performance. The effect of feature selection and the sensitivity of the above classification results to changes in breast lesion contours is also studied.

The design of effective measurement operators is typically constrained by the underlying hardware and physics, posing a challenging and often even discrete optimization task. While the potential of gradient-based learning via the unrolling of iterative recovery algorithms has been demonstrated, it has remained unclear how to leverage this technique when the set of admissible measurement operators is structured and discrete. We tackle this problem by combining unrolled optimization with Gumbel reparametrizations, which enable the computation of low-variance gradient estimates of categorical random variables. Our approach is formalized by GLODISMO (Gradient-based Learning of DIscrete Structured Measurement Operators). This novel method is easy-to-implement, computationally efficient, and extendable due to its compatibility with automatic differentiation.

Change Detection in Hyperdimensional Images Using Untrained Models,IEEE Journal of Selected Topics in Applied Earth Observations and Remote Sensing,14,,10.1109/JSTARS.2021.3121556,S. Saha; L. Kondmann; Q. Song; X. X. Zhu,2021,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9582825,IEEE Journals,"Deep transfer-learning-based change detection methods are dependent on the availability of sensor-specific pretrained feature extractors. Such feature extractors are not always available due to lack of training data, especially for hyperspectral sensors and other hyperdimensional images. Moreover models trained on easily available multispectral (RGB/RGB-NIR) images cannot be reused on such hyperdimensional images due to their irregular number of bands. While hyperdimensional images show large number of spectral bands, they generally show much less spatial complexity, thus reducing the requirement of large receptive fields of convolution filters. Recent works in the computer vision have shown that even untrained deep models can yield remarkable result in some tasks like super-resolution and surface reconstruction. This motivates us to make a bold proposition that untrained lightweight deep model, initialized with some weight initialization strategy, can be used to extract useful semantic features from bi-temporal hyperdimensional images. Based on this proposition, we design a novel change detection framework for hyperdimensional images by extracting bitemporal features using an untrained model and further comparing the extracted features using deep change vector analysis to distinguish changed pixels from the unchanged ones.

Since tree crown diameter estimation is challenging from spaceborne LiDAR measurements, we develop a model to correlate tree height with biomass on the individual-tree levels employing a Gaussian process regressor. In order to validate the proposed model, a set of 8342 samples on tree height, trunk diameter, and biomass has been assembled. It covers seven biomes globally present. We reference our model to four other models based on both, the Jucker data and our own dataset. Although our approach deviates from standard biomass–height–diameter models, we demonstrate the Gaussian process regression model as a viable alternative. In addition, we decompose the uncertainty of tree biomass estimates into the model- and fitting-based contributions. We verify the Gaussian process regressor has the capacity to reduce the fitting uncertainty down to below 5%. Exploiting airborne LiDAR measurements and a field inventory survey on the ground, a stand-level (or plot-level) study confirms a low relative error of below 1% for our model.

Patch-Level Unsupervised Planetary Change Detection,IEEE Geoscience and Remote Sensing Letters,19,,10.1109/LGRS.2021.3130862,S. Saha; X. X. Zhu,2022,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9627685,IEEE Journals,"Change detection (CD) is critical for analyzing data collected by planetary exploration missions, e.g., for identification of new impact craters. However, CD is still a relatively new topic in the context of planetary exploration. Sheer variation of planetary data makes CD much more challenging than in the case of Earth observation (EO). Unlike CD for EO, patch-level decision is preferred in planetary exploration as it is difficult to obtain perfect pixelwise alignment/coregistration between the bi-temporal planetary images. Lack of labeled bi-temporal data impedes supervised CD. To overcome these challenges, we propose an unsupervised CD method that exploits a pretrained feature extractor to obtain bi-temporal deep features that are further processed using global max-pooling to obtain patch-level feature description. Bi-temporal patch-level features are further analyzed based on difference to determine whether a patch is changed. Additionally, a self-supervised method is proposed to estimate the decision boundary between the changed and unchanged patches. Experimental results on three planetary CD datasets from two different planetary bodies (Mars and Moon) demonstrate that the proposed method often outperforms supervised planetary CD methods.

Multitarget Domain Adaptation for Remote Sensing Classification Using Graph Neural Network,IEEE Geoscience and Remote Sensing Letters,19,,10.1109/LGRS.2022.3149950,S. Saha; S. Zhao; X. X. Zhu,2022,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9706461,IEEE Journals,"Remote sensing deals with huge variations in geography, acquisition season, and a plethora of sensors. Considering the difficulty of collecting labeled data uniformly representing all scenarios, data-hungry deep learning models are often trained with labeled data in a source domain that is limited in the above-mentioned aspects. Domain adaptation (DA) methods can adapt such model for applying on target domains with different distributions from the source domain. However, most remote sensing DA methods are designed for single-target, thus requiring a separate target classifier to be trained for each target domain. To mitigate this, we propose multitarget DA in which a single classifier is learned for multiple unlabeled target domains. To build a multitarget classifier, it may be beneficial to effectively aggregate features from the labeled source and different unlabeled target domains. Toward this, we exploit coteaching based on the graph neural network that is capable of leveraging unlabeled data. We use a sequential adaptation strategy that first adapts on the easier target domains assuming that the network finds it easier to adapt to the closest target domain. We validate the proposed method on two different datasets, representing geographical and seasonal variation.

X. Zhu,2022,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9855519,IEEE Journals,"High-resolution remote sensing images are now available with the progress of remote sensing technology. With respect to popular remote sensing tasks, such as scene classification, image captioning provides comprehensible information about such images by summarizing the image content in human-readable text. Most existing remote sensing image captioning methods are based on deep learning-based encoder–decoder frameworks, using convolutional neural network or recurrent neural network as the backbone of such frameworks. Such frameworks show a limited capability to analyze sequential data and cope with the lack of captioned remote sensing training images. Recently introduced Transformer architecture exploits self-attention to obtain superior performance for sequence-analysis tasks. Inspired by this, in this work, we employ a Transformer as an encoder–decoder for remote sensing image captioning. Moreover, to deal with the limited training data, an auxiliary decoder is used that further helps the encoder in the training process. The auxiliary decoder is trained for multilabel scene classification due to its conceptual similarity to image captioning and capability of highlighting semantic classes. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work exploiting multilabel classification to improve remote sensing image captioning. Experimental results on the University of California (UC)-Merced caption dataset show the efficacy of the proposed method.

On the one hand, the risks and threats for the principles of good governance (among them, transparency) derived from the use of AI by governments in sensitive areas such as that of National Security. While AI is to make it easier and more efficient the work of Security Forces, our democracies will become weaker and less credible if the protection of our rights and principles becomes lower than it is thanks to these AI systems, with a risk for autocracies to arise. Thus, our goal should be to produce National Security AI systems that are ethic and legal in a moment of history in which transparency is considered essential for good governance. On the other hand, the use of new disruptive technologies to protect State secrets only makes it more and more difficult to monitor the policies of our governments. The fact is that transparency becomes a reality by exercising the right of access to public information. If we are not allowed to properly monitor our leaders, as a matter of fact protected by smart shields such as those AI systems, we would have taken one step back. Our aims would be carefully identifying the threats to our principles and rights, in the first place, and, secondly suggesting the ethic and legal traits of AI systems to be considered by policymakers that are currently amending State secrets regulations In the case of Spain, a lack of coherence pervades the corresponding legislation, if we take into account that the Official Secrets Law is dated in 1968, nothing to do with the last National Strategy of Security (2021).

The tool would consider application data and recommend whether to give a loan and for how much. It would even seek out prospective borrowers online for new business and offer loans. Or, suppose we were to develop a career coach that recommends career tracks and training based on a user’s career goal, biosketch, and time and money available to invest in training. Applications of AI in decision support are not hypothetical, and applications such as loan processing and career coaching are becoming mainstream. However, although like other algorithms, their inputs and outputs are data; these AI applications are embedded in society, their decisions and recommendations have direct effects on people’s lives. Denial of a loan reduces financial options and may harm a borrower’s wellbeing, while giving a loan but at usurious interest rates might expose a borrower to financial ruin. Likewise, whereas career advice can be valuable to someone who does not have strong mentors, narrow or biased career advice can impede their future and, through them, their family’s prospects.",,"University of Edinburgh, Edinburgh, U.K.; University of South Carolina, Columbia, SC, USA; University of South Carolina, Columbia, SC, USA; North Carolina State University, Raleigh, NC, USA",10 Dec 2021,,,5,6,1941-0131,,,Special issues and sections;Sociotechnical systems;Artificial intelligence;Ethics;Stakeholders;Multi-agent systems;Training data;Decision making,,,,,0,IEEE,10 Dec 2021,IEEE

Semi-structured qualitative interviews were conducted among service users (n = 17) and peer support specialists (n = 15) from a convenience sample at an urban community mental health center in the United States. We identified technology ownership and use, lack of technology literacy including limited understanding of privacy, confidentiality, and security as the main barriers to engagement among service users. Peers demonstrated a high level of technology engagement, literacy of digital mental health tools, and a more comprehensive awareness of digital mental health ethics. We recommend peer support specialists as a potential resource to facilitate the ethical engagement of digital mental health interventions for service users. Finally, engaging potential end-users in the development cycle of digital mental health support platforms and increased privacy regulations may lead the field to a better understanding of effective uses of technology for people with mental health conditions.

Commendably Ofqual (the U.K. Government Office of Qualifications and Examinations Regulation) were transparent in their use of the algorithm so that affected stakeholders were informed of the algorithm’s existence and the key details of how it was developed. The design of the data set produced an algorithm with biased outputs, which hardcoded preexisting educational, policy, and societal biases. Due to the large numbers of students, the single “results day” output and the wider interests of schools, teachers, parents, and universities, the unfairness of the outcome was magnified. Add to this that the students were, by definition, academically proficient individuals, many of whom derived from privileged and supportive backgrounds, which meant that they had the awareness and capacity to challenge. Hence, the impact of this biased algorithm was not received silently and so it was hard to deny, deflect, and dismiss. However, this is not always the case, and many systems are deployed with similar biases and harmful outcomes but the impact is dissipated over time and individuals, and therefore not so immediately obvious and easy to challenge.

The success of these technologies is dependent on the utilization of decentralized systems like blockchains, which can store and validate data on identities and reputations and facilitate the exchange of virtual assets. Full nodes, which store the entire blockchain state and validate all transactions, are essential for the decentralization and reliability of the network. However, operating a full node is resource-intensive and can be expensive. To tackle this challenge, we propose an incentive mechanism that utilizes contract-theoretic methods to economically motivate users to support the sustainability and growth of the blockchain network. Our contract design addresses the problem of information asymmetry (e.g., users' revenue-generating capabilities and efforts) between users and the blockchain network. Additionally, we recommend providing diverse incentives based on the user's revenue-generating capabilities and efforts to assist the blockchain network in funding incentives. Our experimental results demonstrate that our proposed mechanism increases the blockchain network's utility by $48.48\%-54.52\%$ and reduces the users' cost by $38.46\%-62.5\%$ compared with the state-of-the-art implementations such as Celo, Vipnode, and Pocket Network.",Web 3.0;Metaverse;blockchain;incentive mechanism;contract theory,"Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Houston, Houston, TX, USA; Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Houston, Houston, TX, USA; School of Computer Science and Engineering, Nanyang Technological University, Singapore; School of Electrical and Information Engineering, Tianjin University, Tianjin, China; School of Electronic and Optical Engineering, Nanjing University of Science and Technology, Nanjing, China; Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Houston, Houston, TX, USA",14 Jun 2023,,,171,184,2644-1268,,"National Research Foundation; Singapore and Infocomm Media Development Authority; Future Communications Research Development Programme; DSO National Laboratories; AI Singapore Programme(grant numbers:AISG Award AISG2-RP-2020-019); Energy Research Test-Bed and Industry Partnership Funding Initiative; Energy Grid (EG) 2.0 Programme; DesCartes and the Campus for Research Excellence and Technological Enterprise; NSF(grant numbers:CNS-2107216,CNS-2128368,CMMI-2222810); U.S. Department of Transportation, Toyota; ",Blockchains;Peer-to-peer computing;Contracts;Costs;Metaverse;Hazards;Ethics,blockchains;contracts;cryptocurrencies;incentive schemes;Internet,blockchain network;blockchains;contract design;contract-theoretic methods;decentralized systems;diverse incentives;diversified incentive mechanism design;economically motivate users;entire blockchain state;funding incentives;Metaverse;reliability;user,,2,25,CCBY,23 Mar 2023,IEEE

As of late, OSNs have seen critical development and accepted much consideration in exploration. These Networks have consistently been a significant part of daily life; however, since an ever-increasing number of individuals are associated with the internet, their online partners satisfy an undeniably significant job. Users use online applications where they end up sharing lots of information including personal data. Hence this data including huge information is money-making for data owners and they share data with third parties like advertisers who are ethical users. This data also consists of personal data. As data can be used for unethical purposes by unauthorized users which leads to different attacks and illegal use of data and personal information. It is fundamental to first anonymize users’ data before imparting it to any of the third parties like advisers. Anonymization preserves data privacy.

Here, we share our experiences developing and remotely facilitating an interdisciplinary AI ethics program for secondary students designed to increase teens' awareness and understanding of AI and its societal impacts. Students discussed stories with embedded ethical dilemmas, engaged with AI media and simulations, and created digital products to express their stance on an AI ethics issue.

Informing the user about what data is collected and how it is processed is key to reaching transparency, trustworthiness, and ethics in modern systems.

The ethical impact of AI has been recognized as a social issue, and countries and organizations have formulated principles and guidelines on AI ethics, and laws and regulations will be enforced in Europe. Because these principles and guidelines are written in terms of philosophy and law, AI service providers, developers, and business users have the challenge of how they should practice the principles and guidelines to their AI systems. To address this challenge, we first analyzed cases of ethical problems caused by AI in the past and assumed that ethical problems could be linked to interactions between components of AI systems and stakeholders related to such systems. On the basis of this assumption, we then developed a methodology to comprehensively extract the ethical risks that an AI system poses. This methodology consists of two approaches. The first approach is to develop an AI ethics model that embodies ethics guidelines as necessary requirements for ethical AI systems and correlates these requirements with interactions. The second approach is an impact assessment process that uses the AI ethics models to extract ethical risks for individual AI systems. In this paper, we discuss the details of this methodology and show the results of an initial validation to verify the above assumption and the ease of the impact assessment process.",AI ethics;AI governance;responsible AI;impact assessment;risk-based approach,"Fujitsu Limited, Kawasaki, Japan; Fujitsu Limited, Kawasaki, Japan; Fujitsu Limited, Kawasaki, Japan; Fujitsu Limited, Kawasaki, Japan",20 Oct 2022,,,152,161,2770-6834,978-1-6654-6000-2,Stanford University; ,Ethics;Philosophical considerations;Conferences;Europe;Organizations;Regulation;Requirements engineering,artificial intelligence;ethical aspects,artificial intelligence systems;AI ethics guidelines;AI service providers;ethical risks;ethical AI systems;AI ethics impact assessment;requirement engineering,,2,27,IEEE,20 Oct 2022,IEEE

However, emails are sent in plain text by default and allow attackers easy access. Users can protect their emails by end-to-end encrypting them using tools such as S/MIME or PGP.Although PGP had already been introduced in 1991, it is a commonly held belief that email encryption is a niche tool that has not seen widespread adoption to date. Previous user studies identified ample usability issues with email encryption such as key management and user interface challenges, which likely contribute to the limited success of email encryption.However, so far ground truth based on longitudinal field data is missing in the literature. Towards filling this gap, we measure the use of email encryption based on 27 years of data for 37,089 users at a large university. While attending to ethical and data privacy concerns, we were able to analyze the use of S/MIME and PGP in 81,612,595 emails.We found that only 5.46% of all users ever used S/MIME or PGP. This led to 0.06% encrypted and 2.8% signed emails. Users were more likely to use S/MIME than PGP by a factor of six. We saw that using multiple email clients had a negative impact on signing as well as encrypting emails and that only 3.36% of all emails between S/MIME users who had previously exchanged certificates were encrypted on average.Our results imply that the adoption of email encryption is indeed very low and that key management challenges negatively impact even users who have set up S/MIME or PGP previously.",email;encryption;smime;pgp;s/mime;email-encryption,"Leibniz University, Hannover; Freie Universität, Berlin; Freie Universität, Berlin; Max Planck Institute for Security and Privacy; Leibniz University, Hannover",27 Jul 2022,,,860,875,2375-1207,978-1-6654-1316-9,,Data privacy;Ethics;Rollover;User interfaces;Filling;Electronic mail;Encryption,computer crime;cryptography;data protection;educational institutions;electronic mail;ethical aspects;Internet;text analysis;user interfaces,email clients;email encryption;PGP;university;communication tools;plain text;email protection;end-to-end encryption;S/MIME;usability issues;key management;user interface;data privacy;ethical concerns,,3,46,IEEE,27 Jul 2022,IEEE

One approach to a robust realtime system is to sense and automatically integrate multiple nonverbal sources. We investigated how users’ touch, and secondarily gaze, perform as affect-encoding modalities during physical interaction with a robot pet, in comparison to more-studied biometric channels. To elicit authentically experienced emotions, participants recounted two intense memories of opposing polarity in Stressed-Relaxed or Depressed-Excited conditions. We collected data (N=30) from a touch sensor embedded under robot fur (force magnitude and location), a robot-adjacent gaze tracker (location), and biometric sensors (skin conductance, blood volume pulse, respiration rate). Cross-validation of Random Forest classifiers achieved best-case accuracy for combined touch-with-gaze approaching that of biometric results: where training and test sets include adjacent temporal windows, subject-dependent prediction was 94% accurate. In contrast, subject-independent Leave-One-participant-Out predictions resulted in 30% accuracy (chance 25%). Performance was best where participant information was available in both training and test sets. Addressing computational robustness for dynamic, adaptive realtime interactions, we analyzed subsets of our multimodal feature set, varying sample rates and window sizes.

In this article we introduce a new dataset called TWISCO, which proposes an alternative approach to classifying expressions of suicidality online. For this, we use a coding framework developed in Psychology to distinguish between different mentions of suicide. Next, we present a variety of machine and deep learning baselines in three different classification settings (text only, features only and text and features).

Hence, in this paper, we propose a spatio-temporal model for representing secondary affect data from network sciences' perspective. We propose a network science-based model to represent spatio-temporal data, e.g., action units' sequences, and continuous affect reports. In particular, the proposed model captures the spatial and temporal strength of the relationship among essential variables in the data. The proposed model allows to analyze data as a whole system. We also demonstrated the use case of the model for graph analytics on secondary affect data that can assist to measure and quantify several issues that can be originated from the study setup, data recording devices, and the influences/biases that can originate from the perspective of the affect reporters.

These principles outline high-level precepts to guide the ethical development, deployment, and governance of AI. However, the abstract nature, diversity, and context-dependence of these principles make them difficult to implement and operationalize, resulting in gaps between principles and their execution. Most recent work analyzed and summarized existing AI principles and guidelines but did not provide findings on principle-to-practice gaps nor how to mitigate them. These findings are particularly important to ensure that AI practical guidances are aligned with ethical principles and values.

Detox Loss: Fairness Constraints for Learning With Imbalanced Data,"IEEE Transactions on Biometrics, Behavior, and Identity Science",5,2,10.1109/TBIOM.2022.3222048,S. Nagpal; M. Singh; R. Singh; M. Vatsa,2023,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9951384,IEEE Journals,"Recent studies have highlighted a major caveat in several popular deep learning based face recognition algorithms. Despite their high accuracy, they have shown to exhibit biased behavior by achieving sub-par performance on images belonging to different sub-groups. Such behavior can often lead to unfair predictions, thus presenting a need to develop fairer models with unprejudiced behavior. This research proposes Detox loss, a novel bias invariant feature learning loss function for learning unbiased models. The proposed loss can be used to: (i) learn fairer deep learning classifiers, and (ii) mitigate bias from existing pre-trained networks, especially in the challenging constraint of imbalanced training data with respect to a protected attribute. Conceptually, the Detox loss enforces that the learned features are distinguished based on the task label only, while eliminating any distinction based on the biasing-attribute. This is achieved by incorporating three fairness constraints while training with the traditional classification loss: (i) proposed Exclusion loss, (ii) proposed Inclusion loss, and (iii) proposed Feature-distillation loss. The efficacy of the Detox loss is demonstrated on two facial analysis tasks: (i) age-group prediction and (ii) gender prediction, under the protected attribute of ethnicity for learning fairer models and de-biasing existing models, with varying imbalanced training data distributions. Across two different protocols, three setups, and two tasks, the Detox loss obtains state of the art performance without the need of multi-labeled training data. For example, on the challenging Pilot Parliaments Benchmark (PPB) dataset, the Detox loss obtains a balanced accuracy and  $F_{1}$  score of 96.1% and 96.6%, as compared to the state-of-the-art performance of 94.1% and 93.6%, respectively.",Fair classification;imbalanced data;facial analysis,"Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Indraprastha Institute of Information Technology Delhi, New Delhi, India; Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Indraprastha Institute of Information Technology Delhi, New Delhi, India; Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Indian Institute of Technology Jodhpur, Jodhpur, India; Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Indian Institute of Technology Jodhpur, Jodhpur, India",15 May 2023,,,244,254,2637-6407,,TCS Ph.D. Fellowship; Facebooks Ethics in AI Award; Swarnajayanti Fellowship by the Government of India; ,Training data;Data models;Predictive models;Training;Task analysis;Behavioral sciences;Analytical models,deep learning (artificial intelligence);face recognition;feature extraction;image classification;learning (artificial intelligence);pattern classification,bias invariant feature;biased behavior;de-biasing existing models;Detox loss enforces;fairer deep learning classifiers;fairer models;fairness constraints;Feature-distillation loss;imbalanced training data distributions;loss function;multilabeled training data;popular deep learning;proposed Exclusion loss;protected attribute;traditional classification loss,,,51,IEEE,15 Nov 2022,IEEE

However, infant cardiopulmonary monitoring using conventional methods often necessitates skin contact, and they are not suitable for long-term monitoring. This paper introduces a non-contact technique for infant cardiopulmonary monitoring and an adjustable apnea detection algorithm. These are developed using a custom-designed K-band continuous-wave biomedical radar sensor system, which features a DC-coupled adaptive digital tuning function. By using radar technology to detect chest motions without physical contact, it is feasible to extract significant biological information regarding an infant's respiration and heartbeat. The proposed algorithm utilizes an adaptively adjusted threshold and personalized apnea warning time to automatically measure the total number of apneic events and their respective durations. Experiments have been conducted in clinical environment, demonstrating that both the accurate cardiopulmonary signals and the apneas of varying durations can be effectively monitored using this method, which suggest that the proposed technique has potential applications both inside and outside of clinical settings.",Apnea;biomedical radar;millimeter wave;premature infant,"State Key Laboratory of Radio Frequency Heterogeneous Integration, and MoE Key Lab of Artificial Intelligence, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai, China; State Key Laboratory of Radio Frequency Heterogeneous Integration, and MoE Key Lab of Artificial Intelligence, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai, China; Department of Neonatology, International Peace Maternity and Child Health Hospital, Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, Shanghai Key Laboratory of Embryo Original Disease, and Shanghai Municipal Key Clinical Specialty, Shanghai, China; State Key Laboratory of Radio Frequency Heterogeneous Integration, and MoE Key Lab of Artificial Intelligence, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai, China; Department of Neonatology, International Peace Maternity and Child Health Hospital, Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, Shanghai Key Laboratory of Embryo Original Disease, and Shanghai Municipal Key Clinical Specialty, Shanghai, China; Department of Neonatology, International Peace Maternity and Child Health Hospital, Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, Shanghai Key Laboratory of Embryo Original Disease, and Shanghai Municipal Key Clinical Specialty, Shanghai, China; Shanghai AI Laboratory, Shanghai, China; State Key Laboratory of Radio Frequency Heterogeneous Integration, and MoE Key Lab of Artificial Intelligence, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai, China",,,,1,10,1558-2531,,"Medical Research Ethics Committee of International Peace Maternity and Child Health Hospital(grant numbers:GKLW2020-112,ChiCTR2000037015); Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:62188102); Shanghai Jiao Tong University Medical-Engineering Interdisciplinary Research Fund(grant numbers:YG2021ZD29,YG2023QNA30); Clinical Research Plan of SHDC(grant numbers:SHDC2020CR6027); ",Pediatrics;Monitoring;Radar;Millimeter wave radar;Heart rate;Baseband;Skin,,,,,,IEEE,18 Oct 2023,IEEE

Various guidelines, principles, and regulatory frameworks are designed to ensure that AI technologies adhere to ethical well-being. However, the implications of AI ethics principles and guidelines are still being debated. To further explore the significance of AI ethics principles and relevant challenges, we conducted a survey of 99 randomly selected representative AI practitioners and lawmakers (e.g., AI engineers and lawyers) from 20 countries across five continents. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first empirical study that unveils the perceptions of two different types of population (AI practitioners and lawmakers) and the study findings confirm that transparency, accountability, and privacy are the most critical AI ethics principles. On the other hand, lack of ethical knowledge, no legal frameworks, and lacking monitoring bodies are found to be the most common AI ethics challenges. The impact analysis of the challenges across principles reveals that conflict in practice is a highly severe challenge. Moreover, the perceptions of practitioners and lawmakers are statistically correlated with significant differences for particular principles (e.g. fairness and freedom) and challenges (e.g. lacking monitoring bodies and machine distortion).

Hong; N. Yokoya; J. Chanussot; J. Xu; X. X. Zhu,2021,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9256351,IEEE Journals,"Conventional nonlinear subspace learning techniques (e.g., manifold learning) usually introduce some drawbacks in explainability (explicit mapping) and cost effectiveness (linearization), generalization capability (out-of-sample), and representability (spatial–spectral discrimination). To overcome these shortcomings, a novel linearized subspace analysis technique with spatial–spectral manifold alignment is developed for a semisupervised hyperspectral dimensionality reduction (HDR), called joint and progressive subspace analysis (JPSA). The JPSA learns a high-level, semantically meaningful, joint spatial–spectral feature representation from hyperspectral (HS) data by: 1) jointly learning latent subspaces and a linear classifier to find an effective projection direction favorable for classification; 2) progressively searching several intermediate states of subspaces to approach an optimal mapping from the original space to a potential more discriminative subspace; and 3) spatially and spectrally aligning a manifold structure in each learned latent subspace in order to preserve the same or similar topological property between the compressed data and the original data. A simple but effective classifier, that is, nearest neighbor (NN), is explored as a potential application for validating the algorithm performance of different HDR approaches. Extensive experiments are conducted to demonstrate the superiority and effectiveness of the proposed JPSA on two widely used HS datasets: 1) Indian Pines (92.98%) and 2) the University of Houston (86.09%) in comparison with previous state-of-the-art HDR methods.

Background: Developing wearable and collaborative robots require industry collaboration and transdisciplinary competence. Industry’s involvement in long-term programs is becoming infeasible, and the nature of transdisciplinary learning has not been explored to inform instructional practices. Intended Outcomes: This study aimed to provide instructional recommendations based on an in-depth examination of a diverse group of graduate students’ learning and teamwork experiences as well as outcomes in a 5-day online transdisciplinary course. Application Design: Thirty-one graduate students of engineering, industrial design, and health fields from four countries participated in online mixed-discipline instructional sessions and teams to address a real industry challenge. A mixed-methods approach was used to examine students’ experiences and learning outcomes based on a competence measure, session participation data, student journal entries, team progress reports, team elaboration visuals, and final team presentations. Findings: Students’ knowledge of industrial design, medical considerations, ethics and standards, effective teamwork, and self-regulated learning were increased. Students’ high motivation helped them deal with the challenges involved.

Based on a sample of 34 companies, out of which 23 were sanctioned under GDPR due to severe violations of AI ethical principles and using fuzzy-set qualitative comparative analysis, this study demonstrates that to be an AI ethical company and comply with the GDPR regulation, it is necessary to have an AI ethical statement, have a very strong concern for information cybersecurity, and have to be based in a country considered ethical or monitor with care the behavior of the firm in countries with lower ethical standards. As a theoretical contribution, although some authors argue that AI ethical principles are useless, the present research introduces a new theoretical perspective by demonstrating cause–effect relationships between business configurations and AI ethical failures.

It has been theoretically and empirically shown that there exist conflicts and inconsistencies among accuracy and multiple fairness measures. Optimizing one or several fairness measures may sacrifice or deteriorate other measures. Two key questions should be considered: 1) how to simultaneously optimize accuracy and multiple fairness measures and 2) how to optimize all the considered fairness measures more effectively. In this article, we view the mitigating unfairness problem as a multiobjective learning problem, considering the conflicts among fairness measures. A multiobjective evolutionary learning framework is used to simultaneously optimize several metrics (including accuracy and multiple fairness measures) of ML models. Then, ensembles are constructed based on the learning models in order to automatically balance different metrics. Empirical results on eight well-known datasets demonstrate that compared with the state-of-the-art approaches for mitigating unfairness, our proposed algorithm can provide decision makers with better tradeoffs among accuracy and multiple fairness metrics.

SAR Tomography via Nonlinear Blind Scatterer Separation,IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing,59,7,10.1109/TGRS.2020.3022209,Y. Wang; X. X. Zhu,2021,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9200699,IEEE Journals,"Layover separation has been fundamental to many synthetic aperture radar applications, such as building reconstruction and biomass estimation. Retrieving the scattering profile along the mixed dimension (elevation) is typically solved by inversion of the synthetic aperture radar (SAR) imaging model, a process known as SAR tomography. This article proposes a nonlinear blind scatterer separation method to retrieve the phase centers of the layovered scatterers, avoiding the computationally expensive tomographic inversion. We demonstrate that conventional linear separation methods, for example, principle component analysis (PCA), can only partially separate the scatterers under good conditions. These methods produce systematic phase bias in the retrieved scatterers due to the nonorthogonality of the scatterers' steering vectors, especially when the intensities of the sources are similar or the number of images is low. The proposed method artificially increases the dimensionality of the data using kernel PCA, hence mitigating the aforementioned limitations. In the processing, the proposed method sequentially deflates the covariance matrix using the estimate of the brightest scatterer from kernel PCA. Simulations demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed method over conventional PCA-based methods in various respects.

We target the challenge of generalization by curating a large novel data set for training new cloud removal approaches and evaluate two recently proposed performance metrics of image quality and diversity. Our data set is the first publically available to contain a global sample of coregistered radar and optical observations, cloudy and cloud-free. Based on the observation that cloud coverage varies widely between clear skies and absolute coverage, we propose a novel model that can deal with either extreme and evaluate its performance on our proposed data set.

The majority of them use only one spectrum to represent one kind of material, which ignores the spectral variability problem that particularly characterizes a HSI with high spatial resolution. Only a few algorithms have been developed to identify multiple endmembers representing the spectral variability within each class, called endmember bundle extraction (EBE). This article introduces multiobjective particle swarm optimization for the identification of multiple endmember spectra with variability. Unlike existing convex geometry-based EBE methods, which operate on a single geometry of the dataspace, the proposed method divides the observed data into subsets along the spectral dimension and simultaneously operates on multiple dataspaces to obtain candidate endmembers based on multiobjective particle swarm optimization. The candidate endmembers are then refined by spatial post-processing and sequential forward floating selection to produce the final result.

This article addresses the issue of individual building segmentation from a single VHR SAR image in large-scale urban areas. To achieve this, we introduce building footprints from geographic information system (GIS) data as a complementary information and propose a novel conditional GIS-aware network (CG-Net). The proposed model learns multilevel visual features and employs building footprints to normalize the features for predicting building masks in the SAR image. We validate our method using a high-resolution spotlight TerraSAR-X image collected over Berlin. Experimental results show that the proposed CG-Net effectively brings improvements with variant backbones. We further compare two representations of building footprints, namely, complete building footprints and sensor-visible footprint segments, for our task, and conclude that the use of the former leads to better segmentation results. Moreover, we investigate the impact of inaccurate GIS data on our CG-Net, and this study shows that CG-Net is robust against positioning errors in the GIS data. In addition, we propose an approach of ground truth generation of buildings from an accurate digital elevation model (DEM), which can be used to generate large-scale SAR image data sets.

However, they are usually trained only as single-purpose models to either segment land and water or delineate the coastline. In contrast to this, a human annotator will usually keep a mental map of both segmentation and delineation when performing manual coastline detection. To take into account this task duality, we, therefore, devise a new model to unite these two approaches in a deep learning model. By taking inspiration from the main building blocks of a semantic segmentation framework (UNet) and an edge detection framework (HED), both tasks are combined in a natural way. Training is made efficient by employing deep supervision on side predictions at multiple resolutions. Finally, a hierarchical attention mechanism is introduced to adaptively merge these multiscale predictions into the final model output. The advantages of this approach over other traditional and deep learning-based methods for coastline detection are demonstrated on a data set of Sentinel-1 imagery covering parts of the Antarctic coast, where coastline detection is notoriously difficult.

It reduces redundancy among spectral bands while trying to preserve the original information of the image. By now, many efforts have been made to develop unsupervised band selection approaches, of which the majorities are heuristic algorithms devised by trial and error. In this article, we are interested in training an intelligent agent that, given a hyperspectral image, is capable of automatically learning policy to select an optimal band subset without any hand-engineered reasoning. To this end, we frame the problem of unsupervised band selection as a Markov decision process, propose an effective method to parameterize it, and finally solve the problem by deep reinforcement learning. Once the agent is trained, it learns a band-selection policy that guides the agent to sequentially select bands by fully exploiting the hyperspectral image and previously picked bands. Furthermore, we propose two different reward schemes for the environment simulation of deep reinforcement learning and compare them in experiments. This, to the best of our knowledge, is the first study that explores a deep reinforcement learning model for hyperspectral image analysis, thus opening a new door for future research and showcasing the great potential of deep reinforcement learning in remote sensing applications.

Most existing approaches addressing this problem fall back on convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to learn semantic masks of buildings. However, one limitation of their results is blurred building boundaries. To address this, we propose to learn attraction field representation for building boundaries, which is capable of providing an enhanced representation power. Our method comprises two elemental modules: an Img2AFM module and an AFM2Mask module. More specifically, the former aims at learning an attraction field representation conditioned on an input image, which is capable of enhancing building boundaries and suppressing the background. The latter module predicts segmentation masks of buildings using the learned attraction field map. The proposed method is evaluated on three datasets with different spatial resolutions: the ISPRS dataset, the INRIA dataset, and the Planet dataset.

Zhu,2022,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9538396,IEEE Journals,"Most change detection (CD) methods assume that prechange and postchange images are acquired by the same sensor. However, in many real-life scenarios, e.g., natural disasters, it is more practical to use the latest available images before and after the occurrence of incidence, which may be acquired using different sensors. In particular, we are interested in the combination of the images acquired by optical and synthetic aperture radar (SAR) sensors. SAR images appear vastly different from the optical images even when capturing the same scene. Adding to this, CD methods are often constrained to use only target image-pair, no labeled data, and no additional unlabeled data. Such constraints limit the scope of traditional supervised machine learning and unsupervised generative approaches for multisensor CD. The recent rapid development of self-supervised learning methods has shown that some of them can even work with only few images.

Jin; X. X. Zhu,2022,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9537917,IEEE Journals,"Aerial scene recognition is a fundamental research problem in interpreting high-resolution aerial imagery. Over the past few years, most studies focus on classifying an image into one scene category, while in real-world scenarios, it is more often that a single image contains multiple scenes. Therefore, in this article, we investigate a more practical yet underexplored task—multiscene recognition in single images. To this end, we create a large-scale dataset, called MultiScene, composed of 100 000 unconstrained high-resolution aerial images. Considering that manually labeling such images is extremely arduous, we resort to low-cost annotations from crowdsourcing platforms, e.g., OpenStreetMap (OSM). However, OSM data might suffer from incompleteness and incorrectness, which introduce noise into image labels. To address this issue, we visually inspect 14 000 images and correct their scene labels, yielding a subset of cleanly annotated images, named MultiScene-Clean. With it, we can develop and evaluate deep networks for multiscene recognition using clean data. Moreover, we provide crowdsourced annotations of all images for the purpose of studying network learning with noisy labels. We conduct experiments with extensive baseline models on both MultiScene-Clean and MultiScene to offer benchmarks for multiscene recognition in single images and learning from noisy labels for this task, respectively.

An Advanced Dirichlet Prior Network for Out-of-Distribution Detection in Remote Sensing,IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing,60,,10.1109/TGRS.2022.3140324,J. Gawlikowski; S. Saha; A. Kruspe; X. X. Zhu,2022,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9668955,IEEE Journals,"Remote sensing deals with a plethora of sensors, a large number of classes/categories, and a huge variation in geography. Due to the difficulty of collecting labeled data uniformly representing all scenarios, data-hungry deep learning models are often trained with labeled data in a source domain that is limited in the above-mentioned aspects. However, during the test/inference phase, such deep learning models are often subjected to a distributional shift, also called out-of-distribution (OOD) samples, in the form of unseen classes, geographic differences, and multisensor differences. Deep learning models can behave in an unexpected manner when subjected to such distributional uncertainties. Vulnerability to OOD data severely reduces the reliability of deep learning models and trusting on such predictions in the absence of any reliability indicator may lead to wrong policy decisions or mishaps in time-bound remote sensing applications. Motivated by this, in this work, we propose a Dirichlet prior network-based model to quantify the distributional uncertainty of deep learning-based remote sensing models. The approach seeks to maximize the representation gap between the in-domain and OOD examples for better segregation of OOD samples at test time. Extensive experiments on several remote sensing image classification datasets demonstrate that the proposed model can quantify distributional uncertainty.

FuTH-Net: Fusing Temporal Relations and Holistic Features for Aerial Video Classification,IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing,60,,10.1109/TGRS.2022.3150917,P. Jin; L. Mou; Y.

Zhu,2022,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9709809,IEEE Journals,"Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are now widely applied to data acquisition due to its low cost and fast mobility. With the increasing volume of aerial videos, the demand for automatically parsing these videos is surging. To achieve this, current research mainly focuses on extracting a holistic feature with convolutions along both spatial and temporal dimensions. However, these methods are limited by small temporal receptive fields and cannot adequately capture long-term temporal dependencies that are important for describing complicated dynamics. In this article, we propose a novel deep neural network, termed Fusing Temporal relations and Holistic features for aerial video classification (FuTH-Net), to model not only holistic features but also temporal relations for aerial video classification. Furthermore, the holistic features are refined by the multiscale temporal relations in a novel fusion module for yielding more discriminative video representations. More specially, FuTH-Net employs a two-pathway architecture: 1) a holistic representation pathway to learn a general feature of both frame appearances and short-term temporal variations and 2) a temporal relation pathway to capture multiscale temporal relations across arbitrary frames, providing long-term temporal dependencies. Afterward, a novel fusion module is proposed to spatiotemporally integrate the two features learned from the two pathways. Our model is evaluated on two aerial video classification datasets, ERA and Drone-Action, and achieves the state-of-the-art results. This demonstrates its effectiveness and good generalization capacity across different recognition tasks (event classification and human action recognition).

Compressive sensing (CS)-based algorithms are generally considered as the state-of-the art in super-resolving TomoSAR, in particular in the single look case. This superior performance comes at the cost of extra computational burdens, because of the sparse reconstruction, which cannot be solved analytically, and we need to employ computationally expensive iterative solvers. In this article, we propose a novel deep learning-based super-resolving TomoSAR inversion approach,  $\boldsymbol {\gamma }$ -Net, to tackle this challenge.  $\boldsymbol {\gamma }$ -Net adopts advanced complex-valued learned iterative shrinkage thresholding algorithm (CV-LISTA) to mimic the iterative optimization step in sparse reconstruction. Simulations show the height estimate from a well-trained  $\boldsymbol {\gamma }$ -Net approaches the Cramér-Rao lower bound (CRLB) while improving the computational efficiency by one to two orders of magnitude comparing to the first-order CS-based methods. It also shows no degradation in the super-resolution power comparing to the state-of-the-art second-order TomoSAR solvers, which are much more computationally expensive than the first-order methods. Specifically,  $\boldsymbol {\gamma }$ -Net reaches more than 90% detection rate in moderate super-resolving cases at 25 measurements at 6 dB SNR. Moreover, simulation at limited baselines demonstrates that the proposed algorithm outperforms the second-order CS-based method by a fair margin.

Although VQA in computer vision has been widely researched, VQA for remote sensing data (RSVQA) is still in its infancy. There are two characteristics that need to be specially considered for the RSVQA task: 1) no object annotations are available in the RSVQA datasets, which makes it difficult for models to exploit informative region representation and 2) there are questions with clearly different difficulty levels for each image in the RSVQA task. Directly training a model with questions in a random order may confuse the model and limit the performance.

However, one limitation of these methods is that they require strong supervisory information from massive annotated samples for network learning. State-of-the-art semi-supervised semantic segmentation networks with consistency training can help deal with this issue by leveraging a large amount of unlabeled data, which encourages the consistency of model output on data perturbation. Considering that rich information is also encoded in feature maps, we propose to integrate the consistency of both features and outputs in the end-to-end network training of unlabeled samples, enabling to impose additional constraints. Prior semi-supervised semantic segmentation networks have established cluster assumption, in which the decision boundary should lie in the vicinity of low sample density. In this work, we observe that for building footprint generation, low-density regions are more apparent at the intermediate feature representations within the encoder than the encoder’s input or output. Therefore, we propose an instruction to assign the perturbation to the intermediate feature representations within the encoder, which considers the spatial resolution of input remote sensing imagery and the mean size of individual buildings in the study area.

Unsupervised Single-Scene Semantic Segmentation for Earth Observation,IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing,60,,10.1109/TGRS.2022.3174651,S. Saha; M. Shahzad; L. Mou; Q. Song; X. X. Zhu,2022,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9773162,IEEE Journals,"Earth observation data have huge potential to enrich our knowledge about our planet. An important step in many Earth observation tasks is semantic segmentation. Generally, a large number of pixelwise labeled images are required to train deep models for supervised semantic segmentation. On the contrary, strong intersensor and geographic variations impede the availability of annotated training data in Earth observation. In practice, most Earth observation tasks use only the target scene without assuming availability of any additional scene, labeled or unlabeled. Keeping in mind such constraints, we propose a semantic segmentation method that learns to segment from a single scene, without using any annotation. Earth observation scenes are generally larger than those encountered in typical computer vision datasets. Exploiting this, the proposed method samples smaller unlabeled patches from the scene. For each patch, an alternate view is generated by simple transformations, e.g., addition of noise. Both views are then processed through a two-stream network and weights are iteratively refined using deep clustering, spatial consistency, and contrastive learning in the pixel space.

Zhu,2022,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9854892,IEEE Journals,"Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are widely applied for purposes of inspection, search, and rescue operations by the virtue of low-cost, large-coverage, real-time, and high-resolution data acquisition capacities. Massive volumes of aerial videos are produced in these processes, in which normal events often account for an overwhelming proportion. It is extremely difficult to localize and extract abnormal events containing potentially valuable information from long video streams manually. Therefore, we are dedicated to developing anomaly detection methods to solve this issue. In this article, we create a new dataset, named Drone-Anomaly, for anomaly detection in aerial videos. This dataset provides 37 training video sequences and 22 testing video sequences from seven different realistic scenes with various anomalous events. There are 87488 color video frames (51635 for training and 35853 for testing) with the size of 640  $\times640$  at 30 frames/s. Based on this dataset, we evaluate existing methods and offer a benchmark for this task. Furthermore, we present a new baseline model, anomaly detection with Transformers (ANDTs), which treats consecutive video frames as a sequence of tubelets, utilizes a Transformer encoder to learn feature representations from the sequence, and leverages a decoder to predict the next frame. Our network models normality in the training phase and identifies an event with unpredictable temporal dynamics as an anomaly in the test phase. Moreover, to comprehensively evaluate the performance of our proposed method, we use not only our Drone-Anomaly dataset but also another dataset. We will make our dataset and code publicly available.

Detecting Changes by Learning No Changes: Data-Enclosing-Ball Minimizing Autoencoders for One-Class Change Detection in Multispectral Imagery,IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing,60,,10.1109/TGRS.2022.3200985,L.

Zhu,2022,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9870684,IEEE Journals,"Change detection is a long-standing and challenging problem in remote sensing. Very often, features about changes are difficult to model beforehand, thus making the collection of changed samples a challenging task. In comparison, it is much easier to collect numerous no-change samples. It is possible to define a change detection approach using only easily available annotated no-change samples, which we henceforth call one-class change detection. Autoencoder networks being trained on no-change data are natural candidates for addressing this task due to their superior performance when compared with other one-class classification models. However, the autoencoders usually suffer from the problem of overgeneralization, i.e., they tend to generalize too well, thus risking properly reconstructing changed samples. In this article, we propose a novel data-enclosing-ball minimizing autoencoder (DebM-AE) that is trained with dual objectives—a reconstruction error criterion and a minimum volume criterion. The network learns a compact latent space, where encodings of no-change samples have low intraclass variance, which as counterpart has the identification of changed instances. We conducted extensive experiments on three real-world datasets. Results demonstrate advantages of the proposed method over other competitors.

Although change detection techniques have been successfully developed for many years, these techniques are still limited to experts and facilitators in related fields. In order to provide every user with flexible access to change information and help them better understand land-cover changes, we introduce a novel task: change detection-based visual question answering (CDVQA) on multitemporal aerial images. In particular, multitemporal images can be queried to obtain high-level change-based information according to content changes between two input images. We first build a CDVQA dataset, including multitemporal image–question–answer triplets using an automatic question–answer generation method. Then, a baseline CDVQA framework is devised in this work, and it contains four parts: multitemporal feature encoding, multitemporal fusion, multimodal fusion, and answer prediction. In addition, we also introduce a change enhancing module to multitemporal feature encoding, aiming at incorporating more change-related information. Finally, the effects of different backbones and multitemporal fusion strategies are studied on the performance of CDVQA task.

Zhu,2022,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9969379,IEEE Journals,"Finding sparse solutions of underdetermined linear systems commonly requires the solving of  $L_{1}$  regularized least-squares minimization problem, which is also known as the basis pursuit denoising (BPDN). They are computationally expensive since they cannot be solved analytically. An emerging technique known as deep unrolling provided a good combination of the descriptive ability of neural networks, explainable, and computational efficiency for BPDN. Many unrolled neural networks for BPDN, e.g., learned iterative shrinkage thresholding algorithm and its variants, employ shrinkage functions to prune elements with small magnitude. Through experiments on synthetic aperture radar tomography (TomoSAR), we discover the shrinkage step leads to unavoidable information loss in the dynamics of networks and degrades the performance of the model. We propose a recurrent neural network (RNN) with novel sparse minimal gated units (SMGUs) to solve the information loss issue. The proposed RNN architecture with SMGUs benefits from incorporating historical information into optimization and, thus, effectively preserves full information in the final output. Taking TomoSAR inversion as an example, extensive simulations demonstrated that the proposed RNN outperforms the state-of-the-art deep learning-based algorithm in terms of super-resolution power and generalization ability. It achieved 10%–20% higher double-scatterer detection rate and is less sensitive to phase and amplitude ratio difference between scatterers.

Zhu,2023,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10043671,IEEE Journals,"The domain adaptation (DA) approaches available to date are usually not well suited for practical DA scenarios of remote sensing image classification since these methods (such as unsupervised DA) rely on rich prior knowledge about the relationship between label sets of source and target domains, and source data are often not accessible due to privacy or confidentiality issues. To this end, we propose a practical universal DA (UniDA) setting for remote sensing image scene classification that requires no prior knowledge on the label sets. Furthermore, a novel UniDA method without source data is proposed for cases when the source data are unavailable. The architecture of the model is divided into two parts: the source data generation stage and the model adaptation stage. The first stage estimates the conditional distribution of source data from the pretrained model using the knowledge of class separability in the source domain and then synthesizes the source data. With this synthetic source data in hand, it becomes a UniDA task to classify a target sample correctly if it belongs to any category in the source label set or mark it as “unknown” otherwise. In the second stage, a novel transferable weight that distinguishes the shared and private label sets in each domain promotes the adaptation in the automatically discovered shared label set and recognizes the “unknown” samples successfully. Empirical results show that the proposed model is effective and practical for remote sensing image scene classification, regardless of whether the source data are available or not.

Yet a widely acknowledged issue that occurs when applying the semantic segmentation models to unseen scenery is that the model will perform much poorer than when it was applied to scenery similar to the training data. This phenomenon is usually termed as the domain shift problem. To tackle it, this article presents a self-training-based unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) method. Different from the previous self-training approaches which focus on rectifying and improving the quality of the pseudo labels, we instead seek to exploit feature-level relation among neighboring pixels to structure and regularize the prediction of the adapted model. Based on the assumption that spatial topological relation is maintained despite the impact of the domain shift, we propose a novel self-training mechanism to perform DA by exploiting local relation in the feature space spanned by the teacher model, from which the pseudo labels are generated. Quantitative experiments on four different public benchmarks demonstrate that the proposed method can outperform the other UDA methods.

Recent studies have shown that combining segmentation with edge detection can improve the accuracy of calving front detectors. Building on this observation, we completely rephrase the task as a contour tracing problem and propose a model for explicit contour detection that does not incorporate any dense predictions as intermediate steps. The proposed approach, called “Charting Outlines by Recurrent Adaptation” (COBRA), combines convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for feature extraction and active contour (AC) models for delineation. By training and evaluating several large-scale datasets of Greenland’s outlet glaciers, we show that this approach indeed outperforms the aforementioned methods based on segmentation and edge-detection.

With the advantages of requiring no cumbersome labeled change information, unsupervised CD has attracted extensive attention in the community. However, existing unsupervised CD approaches rarely consider the seasonal and style differences incurred by the illumination and atmospheric conditions in multitemporal images. To this end, we propose a CD with a domain shift setting for remote sensing images. Furthermore, we present a novel unsupervised CD method using a lightweight transformer, called UCDFormer. Specifically, a transformer-driven image translation composed of a lightweight transformer and a domain-specific affinity weight is first proposed to mitigate domain shift between two images with real-time efficiency. After image translation, we can generate the difference map between the translated before-event image and the original after-event image. Then, a novel reliable pixel extraction module is proposed to select significantly changed/unchanged pixel positions by fusing the pseudochange maps of fuzzy c-means clustering and adaptive threshold. Finally, a binary change map is obtained based on these selected pixel pairs and a binary classifier. Experimental results on different unsupervised CD tasks with seasonal and style changes demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed UCDFormer. For example, compared with several other related methods, UCDFormer improves performance on the Kappa coefficient by more than 12%. In addition, UCDFormer achieves excellent performance for earthquake-induced landslide detection when considering large-scale applications.

Monocular height estimation (MHE) is one of the most efficient and timely ways to obtain large-scale geometric information. However, existing works focus primarily on training and testing models using unbiased datasets, which does not align well with real-world applications. Therefore, we propose a new benchmark dataset to study the transferability of height estimation models in a cross-dataset setting. To this end, we first design and construct a large-scale benchmark dataset for cross-dataset transfer learning on the height estimation task. This benchmark dataset includes a newly proposed large-scale synthetic dataset, a newly collected real-world dataset, and four existing datasets from different cities. Next, a new experimental protocol, few-shot cross-dataset transfer, is designed.

HTC-DC Net: Monocular Height Estimation From Single Remote Sensing Images,IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing,61,,10.1109/TGRS.2023.3321255,S. Chen; Y. Shi; Z. Xiong; X. X. Zhu,2023,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10294289,IEEE Journals,"Three-dimensional geoinformation is of great significance for understanding the living environment; however, 3-D perception from remote sensing data, especially on a large scale, is restricted, mainly due to the high costs of 3-D sensors such as light detection and ranging (LiDAR). To tackle this problem, we propose a method for monocular height estimation from optical imagery, which is currently one of the richest sources of remote sensing data. As an ill-posed problem, monocular height estimation requires well-designed networks for enhanced representations to improve the performance. Moreover, the distribution of height values is long-tailed with the low-height pixels, e.g., the background (BG), as the head, and thus, trained networks are usually biased and tend to underestimate building heights. To solve the problems, instead of formalizing the problem as a regression task, we propose HTC-DC Net following the classification–regression paradigm, with the head-tail cut (HTC) and the distribution-based constraints (DCs) as the main contributions. HTC-DC Net is composed of the backbone network as the feature extractor, the HTC-AdaBins module, and the hybrid regression process. The HTC-AdaBins module serves as the classification phase to determine bins adaptive to each input image. It is equipped with a vision transformer (ViT) encoder to incorporate local context with holistic information and involves an HTC to address the long-tailed problem in monocular height estimation for balancing the performances of foreground (FG) and BG pixels. The hybrid regression process does the regression via the smoothing of bins from the classification phase, which is trained via DCs. The proposed network is tested on three datasets of different resolutions, namely ISPRS Vaihingen (0.09 m), Data Fusion Contest 19 (DFC19) (1.3 m), and Global Building Height (GBH) (3 m). The experimental results show the superiority of the proposed network over existing methods by large margins. Extensive ablation studies demonstrate the effectiveness of each design component.

Yu,2021,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9381646,IEEE Journals,"We propose to learn a cascade of globally-optimized modular boosted ferns (GoMBF) to solve multi-modal facial motion regression for real-time 3D facial tracking from a monocular RGB camera. GoMBF is a deep composition of multiple regression models with each is a boosted ferns initially trained to predict partial motion parameters of the same modality, and then concatenated together via a global optimization step to form a singular strong boosted ferns that can effectively handle the whole regression target. It can explicitly cope with the modality variety in output variables, while manifesting increased fitting power and a faster learning speed comparing against the conventional boosted ferns. By further cascading a sequence of GoMBFs (GoMBF-Cascade) to regress facial motion parameters, we achieve competitive tracking performance on a variety of in-the-wild videos comparing to the state-of-the-art methods which either have higher computational complexity or require much more training data. It provides a robust and highly elegant solution to real-time 3D facial tracking using a small set of training data and hence makes it more practical in real-world applications. We further deeply investigate the effect of synthesized facial images on training non-deep learning methods such as GoMBF-Cascade for 3D facial tracking. We apply three types synthetic images with various naturalness levels for training two different tracking methods, and compare the performance of the tracking models trained on real data, on synthetic data and on a mixture of data. The experimental results indicate that, i) the model trained purely on synthetic facial imageries can hardly generalize well to unconstrained real-world data, ii) involving synthetic faces into training benefits tracking in some certain scenarios but degrades the tracking model's generalization ability.

Fairness Under Feature Exemptions: Counterfactual and Observational Measures,IEEE Transactions on Information Theory,67,10,10.1109/TIT.2021.3103206,S. Dutta; P. Venkatesh; P. Mardziel; A. Datta; P. Grover,2021,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9508964,IEEE Journals,"With the growing use of machine learning algorithms in highly consequential domains, the quantification and removal of disparity in decision making with respect to protected attributes, such as gender, race, etc., is becoming increasingly important. While quantifying disparity is essential, sometimes the needs of a business (e.g., hiring) may require the use of certain features that are critical in a way that any disparity that can be explained by them might need to be exempted. For instance, in hiring a software engineer for a safety-critical application, a coding-test score may be a critical feature that is weighed strongly in the decision even if it introduces disparity, whereas other features, such as name, zip code, or reference letters may be used to improve decision-making, but only to the extent that they do not add disparity. In this work, we propose a novel information-theoretic decomposition of the total disparity (a quantification inspired from counterfactual fairness) into two components: a non-exempt component which quantifies the part of the disparity that cannot be accounted for by the critical features, and an exempt component which quantifies the remaining disparity. This decomposition is important: it allows one to check if the disparity arose purely due to the critical features (inspired from the business necessity defense of disparate impact law) and also enables selective removal of the non-exempt component of disparity if desired. We arrive at this decomposition through canonical examples that lead to a set of desirable properties (axioms) that any measure of non-exempt disparity should satisfy. We then demonstrate that our proposed counterfactual measure of non-exempt disparity satisfies all of them. Our quantification bridges ideas of causality, Simpson's paradox, and a body of work from information theory called Partial Information Decomposition (PID). We also obtain an impossibility result showing that no observational measure of non-exempt disparity can satisfy all of the desired properties, which leads us to relax our goals and examine alternative observational measures that satisfy only some of these properties. We perform case studies to show how one can audit existing models as well as train new models while reducing non-exempt disparity.",Algorithmic fairness;causal inference;information measures;Partial Information Decomposition (PID);trustworthy machine learning,"Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Carnegie Mellon University, Pittsburgh, PA, USA; Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Carnegie Mellon University, Pittsburgh, PA, USA; Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Carnegie Mellon University, Pittsburgh, PA, USA; Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Carnegie Mellon University, Pittsburgh, PA, USA; Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Carnegie Mellon University, Pittsburgh, PA, USA",15 Sep 2021,,,6675,6710,1557-9654,,NSF(grant numbers:CCF-1350314); NSF(grant numbers:CNS-1704845); Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA); Air Force Research Laboratory(grant numbers:FA8750-15-2-0277); Cylab Presidential Fellowship 2020; K&L Gates Presidential Fellowship in Ethics and Computational Technologies 2019; Axel Berny Graduate Fellowship 2019; Fellowship in Digital Health from the Center for Machine Learning and Health at Carnegie Mellon University; ,Business;Encoding;Decision making;Software;Predictive models;Data models;Training,decision making;information theory;learning (artificial intelligence);safety-critical software,feature exemptions;decision making;safety-critical application;disparate impact law;nonexempt disparity;machine learning algorithm;software engineer;information-theoretic decomposition;partial information decomposition,,,69,IEEE,9 Aug 2021,IEEE

Collision from the rear, in particular, has been identified as the most common class of accident in the UK, and its influencing factors have been widely studied for many years. Rear-mounted stop lamps, illuminated when braking, are the primary mechanism to alert following drivers to the need to reduce speed or brake. This paper develops a novel brain response approach to measuring subject reaction to different brake light designs. A variety of off-the-shelf brake light assemblies are tested in a physical simulated driving environment to assess the cognitive reaction times of 22 subjects. Eight pairs of LED-based and two pairs of incandescent bulb-based brake light assemblies are used and electroencephalogram (EEG) data recorded. Channel Pz is utilised to extract the P3 component evoked during the decision making process that occurs in the brain when a participant decides to lift their foot from the accelerator and depress the brake. EEG analysis shows that both incandescent bulb-based lights are statistically slower to evoke cognitive responses than all tested LED-based lights. Between the LED designs, differences are evident, but not statistically significant, attributed to the significant amount of movement artifact in the EEG signal.",Brake light reaction time;bulb vs LED brake light;EEG;P300;road safety,"Data Science Research Group, School of Computing, University of Kent, Canterbury, U.K.; School of Engineering and Applied Science, Aston University, Birmingham, U.K.; School of Computing, University of Kent, Canterbury, U.K.; ICT Cluster, Singapore Institute of Technology, Singapore",10 Aug 2022,,,13878,13883,1558-0016,,"Road Safety Trust(grant numbers:RST 90_4_18); Faculty of Sciences Research Ethics Committee, University of Kent(grant numbers:0671819); ",Brakes;Electroencephalography;Vehicles;Hardware;Brain modeling;Light emitting diodes;Shape,brain;cognition;decision making;electroencephalography;LED lamps;light emitting diodes;lighting;medical signal processing;neurophysiology;road accidents;road safety,insufficient separation;rear-mounted stop lamps;brain response approach;subject reaction;different brake light designs;off-the-shelf brake light assemblies;cognitive reaction times;incandescent bulb-based brake light assemblies;incandescent bulb-based lights;cognitive response;brake lights;initiating braking action;road accidents;driver attention,,,22,CCBY,2 Jul 2021,IEEE

The Use of Fuzzy Logic as Augmentation to Quantitative Analysis to Unleash Knowledge of Participants’ Uncertainty When Filling a Survey: Case of Cloud Computing,IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering,34,3,10.1109/TKDE.2020.2993326,I. Kouatli,2022,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9093142,IEEE Journals,"Quantitative analysis is a solid, well established mathematical technique that can be used to analyze the result of survey(s) in a specific field. Survey analysis is usually based on the study of the effect of independent variables on a dependent variable. Although quantitative analysis can use an R-Squared value as a method to measure the strength of the relationship between the independent and dependent variables, it does not capture the effect of participants’ ambiguity when answering questionnaires. The source of such ambiguity stems from the process of completing the survey, whereby the respondent may have answered most of the independent questions with ease, but has difficulty in responding to the overall dependent question (or vice versa). The objective of this paper is to demonstrate the use of fuzzy logic as a mechanism to measure the uncertainty faced by participants when filling a questionnaire. Based on the participants’ responses to the independent variables, the proposed technique uses fuzzy logic inference to measure the subjectivity (qualitative aspect) of the participants’ response to the dependent variable. Beyond quantitative analysis, augmentation with such a fuzzy module can provide clearer picture to analysts when analyzing the survey results. In this paper, Cloud acceptance survey will be used as a vehicle to provide step-by-step explanation of the proposed augmentation technique to unleash the hidden knowledge in similar cases to cloud computing long survey questionnaire where participants may change their mind at the end of the survey causing uncertainty represented in discrepancy of the collected data.

Variational Counterfactual Prediction under Runtime Domain Corruption,IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering,PP,99,10.1109/TKDE.2023.3321893,H. Wen; T. Chen; L. K. Chai; S. Sadiq; J. Gao; H.

However, distribution shift (i.e., domain shift) could happen during runtime, and bigger challenges arise from the impaired accessibility of variables. This is commonly caused by increasing privacy and ethical concerns, which can make arbitrary variables unavailable in the entire runtime data and imputation impractical. We term the co-occurrence of domain shift and inaccessible variables runtime domain corruption, which seriously impairs the generalizability of a trained counterfactual predictor. To counter runtime domain corruption, we subsume counterfactual prediction under the notion of domain adaptation. Specifically, we upper-bound the error w.r.t. the target domain (i.e., runtime covariates) by the sum of source domain error and inter-domain distribution distance. In addition, we build an adversarially unified variational causal effect model, named VEGAN, with a novel two-stage adversarial domain adaptation scheme to reduce the latent distribution disparity between treated and control groups first, and between training and runtime variables afterwards. We demonstrate that VEGAN outperforms other state-of-the-art baselines on individual-level treatment effect estimation in the presence of runtime domain corruption on benchmark datasets.",Causal Effect Estimation;Runtime Domain Corruption;Adversarial Domain Adaptation,"School of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, The University of Queensland, Brisbane, Australia; School of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, The University of Queensland, Brisbane, Australia; Health and Wellbeing Queensland, Brisbane, Australia; School of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, The University of Queensland, Brisbane, Australia; Business School, The University of Sydney, Sydney, Australia; School of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, The University of Queensland, Brisbane, Australia",,,,1,14,1558-2191,,,Runtime;Estimation;Training;Predictive models;Feature extraction;Ethics;Drugs,,,,,,IEEE,4 Oct 2023,IEEE

However, multiple sensors placed on different body parts usually entail discomfort and poor usability for the user. This paper presents an intention detection method that relies on the features extracted from an inertial measurement unit worn on the thigh and an online phase estimator. The algorithm classifies the locomotion mode of the upcoming stride among the three modes of ground-level walking, stair ascent, and stair descent. A two-stage classification process first distinguishes between transient and steady-state strides and then classifies the locomotion mode of the impending stride based on directed acyclic graphs of binary classifiers. The classification is performed at 75% or 85% of the previous stride phase, respectively for steady-state and transient strides. Data were gathered from 10 healthy subjects and processed offline. Feature design and selection were based on the data of all subjects, while the classification performance was assessed by leave-one-subject-out cross-validation. Results presented a median recognition accuracy of 98.7% for steady-state strides and 95.6% for transitions, suggesting that the method was inherently robust to variations in gait cadence, since all of the features were phase-based and not dependent on fixed time intervals.

In contrast to traditional BCIs that require a subject-specific calibration process before being operated, a subject-independent BCI learns a subject-independent model and eliminates subject-specific calibration for new users. However, building subject-independent BCIs remains difficult because electroencephalography (EEG) is highly noisy and varies by subject. In this study, we propose an invariant pattern learning method based on a convolutional neural network (CNN) and big EEG data for subject-independent P300 BCIs. The CNN was trained using EEG data from a large number of subjects, allowing it to extract subject-independent features and make predictions for new users. We collected EEG data from 200 subjects in a P300-based spelling task using two different types of amplifiers.

Inter-Subject Domain Adaptation for CNN-Based Wrist Kinematics Estimation Using sEMG,IEEE Transactions on Neural Systems and Rehabilitation Engineering,29,,10.1109/TNSRE.2021.3086401,T. Bao; S. A. R.

Zhang,2021,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9446851,IEEE Journals,"Recently, convolutional neural network (CNN) has been widely investigated to decode human intentions using surface Electromyography (sEMG) signals. However, a pre-trained CNN model usually suffers from severe degradation when testing on a new individual, and this is mainly due to domain shift where characteristics of training and testing sEMG data differ substantially. To enhance inter-subject performances of CNN in the wrist kinematics estimation, we propose a novel regression scheme for supervised domain adaptation (SDA), based on which domain shift effects can be effectively reduced. Specifically, a two-stream CNN with shared weights is established to exploit source and target sEMG data simultaneously, such that domain-invariant features can be extracted. To tune CNN weights, both regression losses and a domain discrepancy loss are employed, where the former enable supervised learning and the latter minimizes distribution divergences between two domains. In this study, eight healthy subjects were recruited to perform wrist flexion-extension movements. Experiment results illustrated that the proposed regression SDA outperformed fine-tuning, a state-of-the-art transfer learning method, in both single-single and multiple-single scenarios of kinematics estimation. Unlike fine-tuning which suffers from catastrophic forgetting, regression SDA can maintain much better performances in original domains, which boosts the model reusability among multiple subjects.",sEMG;wrist kinematics estimation;CNN;domain adaptation;transfer learning,"School of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, Institute of Robotics, Autonomous Systems and Sensing, University of Leeds, Leeds, U.K; School of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, Institute of Robotics, Autonomous Systems and Sensing, University of Leeds, Leeds, U.K; School of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, Institute of Robotics, Autonomous Systems and Sensing, University of Leeds, Leeds, U.K; School of Computer Science and Technology, Xidian University, Xi’an, China; School of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, Institute of Robotics, Autonomous Systems and Sensing, University of Leeds, Leeds, U.K",14 Jun 2021,,,1068,1078,1558-0210,,"Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC)(grant numbers:EP/S019219/1); School of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, University of Leeds; National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)(grant numbers:61972302,61962019); Approval of all ethical and experimental procedures and protocols was granted by the MaPS and Engineering Joint Faculty Research Ethics Committee of University of Leeds, U.K.(grant numbers:MEEC 18-002); ",Estimation;Wrist;Kinematics;Training;Feature extraction;Adaptation models;Transfer learning,biomechanics;electromyography;image representation;learning (artificial intelligence);medical signal processing;neural nets;regression analysis,domain-invariant features;CNN weights;regression losses;domain discrepancy loss;supervised learning;healthy subjects;wrist flexion-extension movements;fine-tuning;catastrophic forgetting regression SDA;original domains;multiple subjects;inter-subject domain adaptation;cnn-based wrist kinematics estimation;sEMG;convolutional neural network;decode human intentions;surface Electromyography signals;pre-trained CNN model;severe degradation;inter-subject performances;novel regression scheme;supervised domain adaptation;domain shift effects;two-stream CNN;shared weights,"Biomechanical Phenomena;Electromyography;Humans;Neural Networks, Computer;Wrist;Wrist Joint",24,60,CCBY,4 Jun 2021,IEEE

Key concepts: Understanding how data contribute to discussions of public problems matters, especially in times of crisis during which multiply marginalized communities are disproportionately affected. Critical Data Studies clarifies how data practice and priorities emerging from various domains of power exacerbate structural inequalities. If we recognize, reveal, and reject data practices that cast data as if they were neutral or fixed, we can ensure that our data practices as TPC professionals are more just. Key lessons: 1. Recognize that data are socially constructed and often incomplete. 2. Reveal the overarching social, political, cultural, and economic conditions that shape data collection and by extension, data itself. 3. Reject faulty or biased processes for data interpretation and analysis that perpetuate inequality. Implications for practice: By acknowledging the relationship between data and context, we can promote better, more just data practices, preparing TPC professionals to work alongside community stakeholders in intersectional coalitions and challenging the conditions that lead to unjust data that fail to represent, over-represent, or blatantly misrepresent the realities of vulnerable communities.",Critical data studies (CDS);data;data settings;ethics;social justice,"West Virginia University, Morgantown, WV, USA; West Virginia University, Morgantown, WV, USA",14 Mar 2022,,,241,254,1558-1500,,,COVID-19;Data visualization;Tutorials;Ethics;Pandemics;Writing;Statistics;Social factors;Data collection;Cultural differences;Heuristic algorithms,cultural aspects;economics;Internet;politics;professional communication;social aspects of automation;socio-economic effects,data practice;critical data studies;cast data;TPC professionals;shape data collection;data interpretation;technical and professional communication professional;multiply marginalized communities;social condition;political condition;cultural condition;economic condition,,,58,IEEE,27 Jan 2022,IEEE

Welhausen,2022,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9726517,IEEE Journals,"Background: The linguistic framing strategies used in media reporting on illegal drugs have been extensively documented, but less attention has been directed toward visuals, particularly data visualizations. Literature review: Positioning illegal drug use as a criminal justice problem or a public health issue are types of frameworks that use specific rhetorical strategies. Research questions: 1. What are the rhetorical strategies used in data visualizations published during the crack and opioid drug epidemics, respectively? 2. Do these strategies advance dominant media narratives that crack addiction should be criminalized but opioid addiction should be treated like a public health issue? And if so, how is this accomplished? Methodology: Drawing from the media studies approach previously employed in a study in technical and professional communication (TPC) on information design trends, I apply the concept of “scripto-visual” rhetoric to select data visualizations published by mainstream news media during both drug epidemics. Results: I argue these graphics escalated the perceived threat during both drug epidemics but different scripto-visual rhetorical strategies were used. Conclusions: Attending to ethical considerations in the creation of data visualizations has long been important in TPC, while scholarship has integrated social justice as a core component of the discipline. In the last section of this article, I bring these themes together by arguing that a social justice ethic is needed in data design work. I then propose a critical heuristic constructed from Jones et al.’s positionality, privilege, and power framework that can be used analytically or as an inventional tool to tease out the ways particular scripto-visual rhetorical decisions may be promoting inequities.",Data visualizations;drug epidemics;news media;rhetorical analysis;social justice,"Department of English, Auburn University, Auburn, AL, USA",14 Mar 2022,,,50,69,1558-1500,,,Epidemics;Drugs;Media;Data visualization;Visualization;Ethics;Public healthcare;Social factors,data visualisation;ethical aspects;professional communication;social aspects of automation;social sciences computing,illegal drug use;criminal justice problem;public health issue;data visualizations;opioid drug epidemics;social justice ethic;data design work;precarious data;linguistic framing strategies;scripto-visual rhetorical strategies;media reporting;technical and professional communication;TPC;information design trends;mainstream news media;media narratives;crack drug epidemic,,4,123,IEEE,3 Mar 2022,IEEE

To benefit from novel AI applications in this domain, the risks need to be managed in order to protect the fundamental interests and rights of those affected. This will increase the level to which these systems become ethically acceptable, legally permissible, and socially sustainable.

Project maintainers have opted for varied, and sometimes conflicting, approaches for maintaining their dependencies. Opting for unsuitable approaches can introduce bugs and vulnerabilities into the project, introduce breaking changes, cause extraneous installations, and reduce dependency understandability, making it harder for others to contribute effectively. In this paper, we empirically examine evidence of recurring dependency management issues (dependency smells). We look at the commit data for a dataset of 1,146 active JavaScript repositories to catalog, quantify and understand dependency smells. Through a series of surveys with practitioners, we identify and quantify seven dependency smells with varying degrees of popularity and investigate why they are introduced throughout project history. Our findings indicate that dependency smells are prevalent in JavaScript projects with two or more distinct smells appearing in 80 percent of the projects, but they generally infect a minority of a project’s dependencies. Our observations show that the number of dependency smells tend to increase over time. Practitioners agree that dependency smells bring about many problems including security threats, bugs, dependency breakage, runtime errors, and other maintenance issues.

We analyzed each document in terms of how many of 25 ethical topics were covered and the depth of discussion for those topics. As compared to documents from private entities, NGO and public sector documents reflect more ethical breadth in the number of topics covered, are more engaged with law and regulation, and are generated through processes that are more participatory.

This article proposes three potential strategies to increase the effectiveness and credibility of professional society ethical codes as governance tools. First, enforcement of the codes should be broader and more transparent. Second, employers could be enlisted to help enforce the codes adopted by professional societies, given employers’ greater influence in creating a more compliant and ethical workplace culture.

We examine what this contention means from the perspective of the sociocultural context in which AI systems are designed, developed, and deployed and focus on intersections with anti-Black racism (antiblackness). To bring these multiple perspectives together and show an example of antiblackness in the face of attempts at de-biasing, we discuss results from auditing an existing open-source semantic network (ConceptNet).

Individuality and Fairness in Public Health Surveillance Technology: A Survey of User Perceptions in Contact Tracing Apps,IEEE Transactions on Technology and Society,3,4,10.1109/TTS.2022.3211073,E. Hohma; R. Burnell; C. C. Corrigan; C.

It is therefore vital that machine learning algorithms are applied in ways that are generally considered fair. However, the question of how to define fairness in a public health context is still an open one. In this study, we investigated people’s attitudes towards two ways of defining fairness in the context of Covid-19 contact tracing apps. In the first, ‘high-individuality’ approach, the likelihood of an algorithm asking a person to self-isolate would depend on the person’s individual characteristics, such as their risk of spreading the virus through regular contacts. In the second ‘low individuality’ approach, these individual characteristics would not be used to come to a decision. For each approach, participants rated its fairness, overall quality, and their privacy concerns, and answered questions about basic psychological need satisfaction. Participants rated the high-individuality approach as fairer and better overall compared to the low-individuality approach, despite having greater privacy concerns. Further, we found a strong correlation between the participants’ fairness perceptions and their overall impression of the tracking tool. Together, these findings suggest that people prefer individualised approaches in some contexts and perceive them as fairer. However, policy makers should consider the privacy trade-off of employing such measures.",Algorithmic decision-making;contact tracing;data privacy;fairness;individuality;machine learning;public health surveillance,"Institute for Ethics in Artificial Intelligence, School of Social Sciences and Technology, Technical University of Munich, Munich, Germany; Dyson School of Design Engineering, Imperial College London, London, U.K.; Institute for Ethics in Artificial Intelligence, School of Social Sciences and Technology, Technical University of Munich, Munich, Germany; Institute for Ethics in Artificial Intelligence, School of Social Sciences and Technology, Technical University of Munich, Munich, Germany",15 Dec 2022,,,300,306,2637-6415,,Technical University of Munich’s Institute for Ethics in Artificial Intelligence (IEAI); Leverhulme Centre for the Future of Intelligence; ,COVID-19;Psychology;Public healthcare;Decision making;Surveillance;Machine learning;Data privacy,data privacy;learning (artificial intelligence);psychology,Covid-19 contact tracing apps;Covid-19 pandemic;high-individuality approach;individualised approaches;low-individuality approach;machine learning algorithms;participants;person;public health context;public health measures;public health surveillance technology;regular contacts;second low individuality approach;user perceptions,,2,50,CCBY,30 Sep 2022,IEEE

Taking cues from aforementioned observation, we inspect if deep learning networks also mimic this human behavior, and are affected by in-group and out-group biases. In this first of its kind research, the behavior of face recognition models is evaluated to understand if similar to humans, models also encode group-specific features for face recognition, along with where bias is encoded in these models. Analysis has been performed for two use-cases of bias: age and ethnicity in face recognition models. Thorough experimental evaluation leads us to several insights: (i) deep learning models focus on different facial regions for different ethnic groups and age groups, and (ii) large variation in face verification performance is also observed across different sub-groups for both known and our own trained deep networks. Based on the observations, a novel bias index is presented for evaluating a trained model’s level of bias.

The user can dive inside and see its inner workings, its lungs, spine, brain. The user can take hold of the figure’s outstretched hand: holding the hand triggers the 4D dataset, making the heart beat and lungs breathe. When the user lets go the hand, the heart stops beating and the lungs stop breathing. Deep Connection creates a scenario where an embodied human becomes the companion for a virtual body. This paper maps the conceptual and theoretical framework for Deep Connection such as virtual intimacy and digitally mediated companionship. It also reflects on working with scanned bodies more generally in virtual reality by discussing transparency, the cyberbody versus the data body, as well as data privacy and data ethics.

By performing low-cost joins on multiple datasets with shared attributes, malicious users of open data portals might get access to information that violates individuals’ privacy. However, open data sets are primarily published using a release-and-forget model, whereby data owners and custodians have little to no cognizance of these privacy risks. We address this critical gap by developing a visual analytic solution that enables data defenders to gain awareness about the disclosure risks in local, joinable data neighborhoods. The solution is derived through a design study with data privacy researchers, where we initially play the role of a red team and engage in an ethical data hacking exercise based on privacy attack scenarios. We use this problem and domain characterization to develop a set of visual analytic interventions as a defense mechanism and realize them in PRIVEE, a visual risk inspection workflow that acts as a proactive monitor for data defenders. PRIVEE uses a combination of risk scores and associated interactive visualizations to let data defenders explore vulnerable joins and interpret risks at multiple levels of data granularity.

To prevent such harm, we propose an anti-spoofing method using the pairs of RGB images and depth maps provided by the mobile camera with a time-of-fight sensor. When images are recaptured on display screens, various patterns differing by the screens as known as the moiré patterns can be also captured in spoof images. These patterns lead the anti-spoofing model to be overfitted and unable to detect spoof images recaptured on unseen media. To avoid the issue, we build a novel representation model composed of two embedding models, which can be trained without considering the recaptured images.

Vulnerability Assessment for Applications Security Through Penetration Simulation and Testing,Journal of Web Engineering,21,7,10.13052/jwe1540-9589.2178,P. Lachkov; L. Tawalbeh; S. Bhatt,2022,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10251051,River Publishers Journals,"Cybersecurity threats and attacks are a critical concern for computing systems as general and specifically in web applications. There are many types and categories of cyberattacks on web applications. Many of these attacks are made possible due to existing vulnerabilities in the networking environments and platforms that host these web applications. So, the vulnerability assessment and attacks simulations on these networking platforms are of extreme importance to protect and secure the top web applications that play a prime role in our daily life. One of the widely used mechanisms to identify vulnerabilities and defend against different attacks on systems and networks is Penetration Testing. It allows us to simulate real-world attacks on a network or a single device to determine the susceptibility and impact of cybersecurity attacks. Pen testing aims to secure a system or network by performing a full-blown attack against it. Several techniques have been used for that, from port scanning, service, and operating system detection to network enumeration, creating specially crafted packets, and modifying software to exploit vulnerabilities. However, while it is used widely as a defensive technique, some attackers also employ it for malicious intentions utilizing available open-source penetration testing tools. Penetration testing on internal networks such as networks that connect IoT/sensors/web cameras, can be utilized to find vulnerabilities and fix them to secure the networks. In this research, we present a detailed discussion on penetration testing and its seven phases of action and provide a step-by-step procedure with instructions using various open-source tools to conduct penetration testing and vulnerability assessments of a network.

This has become quite evident with the proliferation of national AI strategies since the first was launched in Canada in 2017. There is now an ever-growing body of national AI strategies especially in countries situated in the Global South. AI is seen as a key driver of economic development and the strategies describe how countries plan to exploit AI technologies to achieve national development goals. However, AI technologies also generate problematic and unintended consequences, and the national strategies often describe governance mechanisms for mitigating such issues. As the national development goals of many countries also align with the UN SDGs, this paper explores the relationship between responsible governance of AI, the attainment of the UN SDGs and the implications for African countries. The paper shows that there is a clear link between the development of AI and the attainment of the SDGs. Also, based on an analysis of two AI policy tracking repositories - the OECD AI Policy Observatory and Oxford AI Readiness Index – this paper shows how African countries have lagged behind countries in the Global South in terms of the development of governance structures for AI.

The Contestation of Tech Ethics: A Sociotechnical Approach to Technology Ethics in Practice,Journal of Social Computing,2,3,10.23919/JSC.2021.0018,B. Green,2021,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9684741,TUP Journals,"This article introduces the special issue “Technology Ethics in Action: Critical and Interdisciplinary Perspectives”. In response to recent controversies about the harms of digital technology, discourses and practices of “tech ethics” have proliferated across the tech industry, academia, civil society, and government. Yet despite the seeming promise of ethics, tech ethics in practice suffers from several significant limitations: tech ethics is vague and toothless, has a myopic focus on individual engineers and technology design, and is subsumed into corporate logics and incentives. These limitations suggest that tech ethics enables corporate “ethics-washing”: embracing the language of ethics to defuse criticism and resist government regulation, without committing to ethical behavior. Given these dynamics, I describe tech ethics as a terrain of contestation where the central debate is not whether ethics is desirable, but what “ethics” entails and who gets to define it. Current approaches to tech ethics are poised to enable technologists and technology companies to label themselves as “ethical” without substantively altering their practices. Thus, those striving for structural improvements in digital technologies must be mindful of the gap between ethics as a mode of normative inquiry and ethics as a practical endeavor. In order to better evaluate the opportunities and limits of tech ethics, I propose a sociotechnical approach that analyzes tech ethics in light of who defines it and what impacts it generates in practice.",technology ethics;AI ethics;ethics-washing;Science;Technology;and Society (STS);sociotechnical systems,"Society of Fellows and the Gerald R.

Algorithmic Silence: A Call to Decomputerize,Journal of Social Computing,2,4,10.23919/JSC.2021.0023,J. Penn,2021,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9698154,TUP Journals,"Tech critics become technocrats when they overlook the daunting administrative density of a digital-first society. The author implores critics to reject structural dependencies on digital tools rather than naturalize their integration through critique and reform. At stake is the degree to which citizens must defer to unelected experts to navigate such density. Democracy dies in the darkness of sysadmin. The argument and a candidate solution proceed as follows. Since entropy is intrinsic to all physical systems, including digital systems, perfect automation is a fiction. Concealing this fiction, however, are five historical forces usually treated in isolation: ghost work, technical debt, intellectual debt, the labor of algorithmic critique, and various types of participatory labor. The author connects these topics to emphasize the systemic impositions of digital decision tools, which compound entangled genealogies of oppression and temporal attrition. In search of a harmonious balance between the use of “AI” tools and the non-digital decision systems they are meant to supplant, the author draws inspiration from an unexpected source: musical notation. Just as musical notes require silence to be operative, the author positions algorithmic silence-the deliberate exclusion of highly abstract digital decision systems from human decision-making environments-as a strategic corrective to the fiction of total automation. Facial recognition bans and the Right to Disconnect are recent examples of algorithmic silence as an active trend.",technocracy;algorithmic silence;history;labor;artificial intelligence;AI ethics;automation;decomputerization,"Department of History and Philosophy of Science, University of Cambridge, Cambridge, UK",31 Jan 2022,,,337,356,2688-5255,,,Vocabulary;Social computing;Automation;Shape;Heuristic algorithms;Music;Rhetoric;Artificial intelligence;Vehicle dynamics;Surface treatment,decision making;social aspects of automation,musical notes;total automation;tech critics;technocrats;digital-first society;structural dependencies;candidate solution;historical forces;technical debt;intellectual debt;algorithmic critique;participatory labor;digital decision tools;temporal attrition;harmonious balance;AI tools;nondigital decision systems;musical notation;human decision-making environment;algorithmic silence,,1,152,,31 Jan 2022,TUP
Data Science as Political Action: Grounding Data Science in a Politics of Justice,Journal of Social Computing,2,3,10.23919/JSC.2021.0029,B. Green,2021,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9684742,TUP Journals,"In response to public scrutiny of data-driven algorithms, the field of data science has adopted ethics training and principles. Although ethics can help data scientists reflect on certain normative aspects of their work, such efforts are ill-equipped to generate a data science that avoids social harms and promotes social justice. In this article, I argue that data science must embrace a political orientation. Data scientists must recognize themselves as political actors engaged in normative constructions of society and evaluate their work according to its downstream impacts on people's lives. I first articulate why data scientists must recognize themselves as political actors. In this section, I respond to three arguments that data scientists commonly invoke when challenged to take political positions regarding their work. In confronting these arguments, I describe why attempting to remain apolitical is itself a political stance—a fundamentally conservative one—and why data science's attempts to promote “social good” dangerously rely on unarticulated and incrementalist political assumptions. I then propose a framework for how data science can evolve toward a deliberative and rigorous politics of social justice. I conceptualize the process of developing a politically engaged data science as a sequence of four stages. Pursuing these new approaches will empower data scientists with new methods for thoughtfully and rigorously contributing to social justice.",data science;ethics;politics;social justice;social change;social good;pedagogy,"Society of Fellows and the Gerald R.

The coastal urban areas are receiving a growing fraction of the population migrating from rural into urban areas. As a result, most of today’s megacities are in the coastal zone or in flood plains of major rivers. This urbanization of the coastal zone is expected to continue for the foreseeable future. At the same time, the coastal zone is exposed to a changing spectrum of natural hazards originating in the atmosphere-ocean and terrestrial systems, including coastal flooding, storms and storm surges, river floods, tsunamis, and sea level rise. While considerable efforts are being made to increase resilience of the urban coast with respect to these hazards, little attention has been paid to future threats posed to the ocean and the marine biosphere by the human presence in the coastal zone. Large efforts are being made to reduce present impacts of human activities on the ocean and the marine biosphere. However, the future risks to the ocean associated with marine debris emerging from the urban coast built in the coastal zone at present is to a large extent overlooked. The way coastal urban areas are developed today creates a risk with potentially large harmful impacts on future generation. Efforts to transform the way urban coasts are developed so that the built environment is adapted to sea level rise and a changing hazard spectrum would help to bring present-day actions in line with our normative ethics. Developing internationally accepted rules for the abandonment of urban coasts that can not longer be defended against encroaching seas would ensure that the threats to the ocean, the marine biosphere and future generations are reduced.",Anthropocene risks;climate change;urban coast;marine debris;marine biosphere,"Mitigation and Adaptation Research Institute Old Dominion University, Norfolk, Va, USA; Dept. of Ocean and Earth Sciences, Old Dominion University, Norfolk, Va, USA; Dept. of Ocean and Earth Sciences, Old Dominion University, Norfolk, Va, USA; Lab-STICC IMT Atlantique, Brest, France",15 Feb 2022,,,1,10,0197-7385,978-0-692-93559-0,,Ethics;Storms;Urban areas;Sea measurements;Transforms;Biosphere;Tsunami;Climate change,air pollution;climatology;floods;hazards;rivers;sea level;storms;tsunami,urban coast;sea level rise;coastal environment;built environment;coastal zone;coastal flooding;marine biosphere;way coastal urban areas;way urban coasts,,,40,,15 Feb 2022,IEEE

This is a serious problem for recommender systems (RS) or similar aplications since personal data (e.g. socioeconomic, demographics, behavioural, etc.) are the most useful for generating tailored correlations and predictions. To cope with this issue, this work proposes a recommender system that safeguards the user privacy by using a Federated Learning approach (FL). To this end, this article takes as the baseline an already existing centralized RS that uses all the data from users in a clear manner. This baseline RS is based on Factor Machines and it aims to employ persuasion strategies adapted to the user to increase energy awareness and change their consumption habits in the work environment. In order to test the performance of the FL-based distributed RS, the real dataset used (N=678) have been separated into four subsets mimicking a segmentation by country of origin (Austria, UK, Spain and Greece). Each country can create an artificial intelligence model suitable for its users that will be sent to a central server where the aggregation of models will take place and the improved global model will be returned back to each country. The simulation of this FL strategy is performed with four Raspberry Pi's reflecting each country and an NVIDIA Jetson Nano is used as the aggregation server. The generated model not only increases the privacy of the users as no raw data travels to the central server but also improves the reliability of the recommendations.",Federated Learning;Recommender System;Incremental Learning;Internet of Things,"Faculty of Engineering, University of Deusto, Bilbao, ES; Faculty of Engineering, University of Deusto, Bilbao, ES; Faculty of Engineering, University of Deusto, Bilbao, ES",21 Oct 2021,,,1,5,,978-953-290-112-2,,Data privacy;Ethics;Costs;Correlation;Law;Computational modeling;Data models,,,,,20,,21 Oct 2021,IEEE

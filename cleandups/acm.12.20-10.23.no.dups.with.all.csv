The approaches of the studies differ in how AI technology, ethics, role of technical artefacts and socio-technical aspects of AI are perceived. In addition, most studies define insufficiently what the connection between the process of embedding ethical frameworks to AI technology and the larger framework of AI ethics is. These deficiencies have caused that the concept of AI ethics and the construct of embedding ethical parameters into AI are used in an ambiguous, rather than in a complementary manner.One reason for the ambiguity within this field of research is due to a lack of a comprehensive conceptual framework for AI ethics in general. I intend to fill this void by grounding AI ethics as a subfield of philosophy of technology and applied ethics and presenting its main issues of study by examining recognized spheres of activities through the method of levels of abstraction [8]. I put forward an initial hierarchical conceptual framework for AI ethics as an outcome. After this, I discuss the connection between the process of embedding ethical frameworks in AI and the larger AI ethics framework, leading to presenting basic requirements for the sphere of activity hereafter known as embedded ethics.",AI ethics; Applied ethics; Embedded ethics; Human-technology interaction,978-3-030-77430-1,,2021,2023-11-06 01:29:48,2023-11-06 01:29:48,311–329,,Springer-Verlag,T2JKNGZ8

Among them are traditional types of organizational accidents but also complex misadventures where the effects of the use of AI technology intertwine with human action in the context of intricate socio-technical settings. The origins of problems range from making errors during a planned course of action to accidents due to unintended and unpredictable outcomes of the use of AI. A variety of ethical principles for the use and design of AI have been formulated to remedy the ills. The article sums up the main concepts of the AI ethical codes and discusses their role in attempts to prevent AI-induced problems. According to recent empirical studies, the impact of ethics principles is weak in terms of real-life AI design and use. As an alternative, the article suggests the findings of safety research as a source for a practice-oriented approach to tackle the problems. A century-long study of safety provides both conceptual models and practical tools for the prevention of accidents and creating the means to improve safety.

While considering a case of an ethical dilemma in education presented in [17], it can be seen how, in these situations, it might be needed to take into consideration the student’s needs, preferences, and potentially conflicting goals, as well as their personal and social contexts. Due to this, planning and foreseeing ethically challenging situations in advance, which would be how ethical design is normally used in technological artifacts, is not enough. As AI systems become more autonomous, the amount of possible situations, choices and effects their actions can have grow exponentially. In this paper, we bring together the analysis of ethical dilemmas in education and the need to incorporate moral reasoning into the AI systems’ decision procedures. We argue how ethical design, although necessary, is not sufficient for that task and that artificial morality, or equivalent tools, are needed in order to integrate some sort of “ethical sensor” into autonomous systems taking a deeper role in an educational settings in order to enable them to, if not resolve, at least identify new ethically-relevant scenarios they are faced with.",AI Ethics; Artificial morality; Ethical sensors; Online learning,978-3-030-77856-9,,2021,2023-11-06 01:30:00,2023-11-06 01:30:00,167–182,,Springer-Verlag,9R7MDFDB

In this paper, we propose a multi-objective evolutionary learning framework for mitigating unfairness caused by considering a single measure only, in which a multi-objective evolutionary algorithm is used during training to balance accuracy and multiple fairness measures simultaneously. In our case study, besides the model accuracy, two fairness measures that are conflicting to each other are selected.

Warnings from regulators, philosophers, and computer scientists about the dangers of unethical AI have spurred interest in automated ethics-i.e., the development of machines that can perform ethical reasoning. However, prior work in automated ethics rarely engages with philosophical literature. Philosophers have spent centuries debating moral dilemmas so automated ethics will be most nuanced, consistent, and reliable when it draws on philosophical literature. In this paper, I present an implementation of automated Kantian ethics that is faithful to the Kantian philosophical tradition. I formalize Kant’s categorical imperative in an embedding of Dyadic Deontic Logic in HOL, implement this formalization in the Isabelle/HOL theorem prover, and develop a testing framework to evaluate how well my implementation coheres with expected properties of Kantian ethic. My system is an early step towards philosophically mature ethical AI agents and it can make nuanced judgements in complex ethical dilemmas because it is grounded in philosophical literature.

Similarly, though technical ML solutions are also required for practical implementation, ML systems are ultimately still software, and thus SE cannot be forgotten. In this paper, we propose one way of bringing AI ethics closer to conventional SE practice: utilizing user stories to implement AI ethics by means of Ethical User Stories (EUS). EUS can be used to formulate both functional and non-functional requirements, although an ethical framework is required produce them.

Using games as an illustration, we attempt to define the structure of normative spaces and argue that any rule-following within a normative space is guided by values that are external to that space and which cannot themselves be represented as rules. In light of this, we categorise the types of mistakes an artificial moral agent could make into Mistakes of Intention and Instrumental Mistakes, and we propose ways of building morality into machines by getting them to interpret the rules we give in accordance with these external values, through explicit moral reasoning, the “Show, not Tell” paradigm, the adjustment of causal power and structure of the agent, and relational values, with the ultimate aim that the machine develop a virtuous character and that the impact of the Interpretation Problem is minimised.",AI ethics; Evaluation of AI systems; Intelligent decision support systems; Interpretation problem; Moral values; Practical reasoning; Rules; Value alignment; Virtue theory; Wittgenstein,978-3-031-21440-0,,2022,2023-11-06 01:30:03,2023-11-06 01:30:03,124–137,,Springer-Verlag,FIBPCPP4

This paper applies user studies of a design support tool to empirically verify that our ethical framework improves the creativity of an engineer’s design activity. The design support tool provides an environment for the promotion of ethical design perspectives and description. The experiments focus on two functionalities: semi-automatic generation and scenario path recommendation. These functions are designed around the application of ethical design theory, which extends the hierarchical representation of artifacts. Doing this enables users to reconsider their themes at the highest level of the hierarchy and to apply a wider conceptual space of design solutions. For example, by reconsidering the positions of their research themes in the space of the representation field, users can semi-automatically edit them and identify focal areas. Using the scenario path recommendation, designers can update their research themes after considering the ethical impacts of those themes on stakeholders. Both functions are realized by exploiting a knowledge base of ethical and technological discourses. Finally, the ethical design theory is updated based on some unexpected results of our user studies with regards to the cyclic relationship among theory, tools (i.e., experimental equipment), and observed data.

In particular, some have been complaining that such an approach to ethics is difficult to be applied and to be taught in the context of data science. In response to these concerns, there have been discussions about how ethics should be “embedded” in the practice of data science, in the sense of showing how ethical issues emerge in small technical choices made by data scientists in their day-to-day activities, and how such an approach can be used to teach data ethics. However, a precise description of how such proposals have to be theoretically conceived and could be operationalized has been lacking. In this article, we propose a full-fledged characterization of ‘embedding’ ethics, and how this can be applied especially to the problem of teaching data science ethics. Using the emerging model of ‘microethics’, we propose a way of teaching daily responsibility in digital activities that is connected to (and draws from) the higher level ethical challenges discussed in digital/data ethics. We ground this microethical approach into a virtue theory framework, by stressing that the goal of a microethics is to foster the cultivation of moral virtues. After delineating this approach of embedding ethics in theoretical detail, this article discusses a concrete example of how such a ‘micro-virtue ethics’ approach could be practically taught to data science students.",Embedded ethics; Data science; Virtue ethics; Microethics; Teaching ethics,,0951-5666,2021-09,2023-11-06 01:30:03,2023-11-06 01:30:03,939–953,,,B9TXHEP8

This paper fills the gap in our current understanding of how organisations deal with AI ethics by presenting empirical findings collected using a set of ten case studies and providing an account of the cross-case analysis.

Using this background, the cross-case analysis categorises the organisational responses that were observed in practice. The discussion shows that organisations are highly aware of the AI ethics debate and keen to engage with ethical issues proactively. However, they make use of only a relatively small subsection of the mitigation strategies proposed in the literature.

Building on critical theory, this article aims to expand the scope of AI ethics by arguing that in addition to ethical principles and design, the organizational dimension (i.e. the background assumptions and values influencing design processes) plays a pivotal role in the operationalization of ethics in AI development and deployment contexts. Through the prism of critical theory, and the notions of underdetermination and technical code as developed by Feenberg in particular, the organizational dimension is related to two general challenges in operationalizing ethical principles in AI: (a) the challenge of ethical principles placing conflicting demands on an AI design that cannot be satisfied simultaneously, for which the term ‘inter-principle tension’ is coined, and (b) the challenge of translating an ethical principle to a technological form, constraint or demand, for which the term ‘intra-principle tension’ is coined. Rather than discussing principles, methods or metrics, the notion of technical code precipitates a discussion on the subsequent questions of value decisions, governance and procedural checks and balances. It is held that including and interrogating the organizational context in AI ethics approaches allows for a more in depth understanding of the current challenges concerning the formalization and implementation of ethical principles as well as of the ways in which these challenges could be met.",Artificial intelligence; Critical theory; Ethics; Feenberg; Organizational operationalization; Philosophy,,0951-5666,2022-12,2023-11-06 01:29:49,2023-11-06 01:29:49,1427–1437,,,I82JZAME

Through a qualitative methodology based on 22 semi-structured interviews and two focus groups, the goal of the current study is to understand how companies approach ethical issues related to AI systems. A structured analysis of the transcripts brought out many actual practices and findings, which are presented around the following main research topics: ethics and principles, privacy, explainability, and fairness. The interviewees also raised issues of accountability and governance. Finally, some recommendations are suggested such as developing specific sector regulations, fostering a data-driven organisational culture, considering the algorithm’s complete life cycle, developing and using a specific code of ethics, and providing specific training on ethical issues.

It impacted numerous contemporary fields like philosophy, literary theories, art, and culture for the last few decades. The movement has been concentrated around the technological development of present days due to industrial advancement in society and the current proliferated daily usage of technology. Posthumanism indicated a deconstruction of our radical conception of ‘human’, and it further shifts our societal value alignment system to a novel dimension. The majority of our population is getting deeply involved in virtual reality in daily life. Sooner or later, we shall get a different conception of ‘biological human being’ through the advancement of artificial intelligence (AI) technology. If an automated artificial system could replace the human brain and repair any physical loss of our biological body, it will certainly become a journey towards immortality for scientists. However, we must analyze whether posthumanism will consider ‘hybrid human beings’ as moral agents, similar to biological humans. This is why, in the future, the relation between biological human beings and posthumans will play an active role in designing artificial moral agents. Whether the future posthumans would overpower biological humanity or both of them would work as peers to form a digital utopian society and create new dimensions of rationality is still a case of anticipation.

We identify two crucial opportunities that AI offers in this domain: it can help improve and expand current understanding of climate change, and it can contribute to combatting the climate crisis effectively. However, the development of AI also raises two sets of problems when considering climate change: the possible exacerbation of social and ethical challenges already associated with AI, and the contribution to climate change of the greenhouse gases emitted by training data and computation-intensive AI systems. We assess the carbon footprint of AI research, and the factors that influence AI’s greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions in this domain. We find that the carbon footprint of AI research may be significant and highlight the need for more evidence concerning the trade-off between the GHG emissions generated by AI research and the energy and resource efficiency gains that AI can offer. In light of our analysis, we argue that leveraging the opportunities offered by AI for global climate change whilst limiting its risks is a gambit which requires responsive, evidence-based, and effective governance to become a winning strategy.

Our previous research sought to start closing this gap between the ‘what’ and the ‘how’ of AI ethics through the creation of a searchable typology of tools and methods designed to translate between the five most common AI ethics principles and implementable design practices.

In reality, it is unclear whether this is the case. It is this limitation that we seek to overcome here by conducting a mixed-methods qualitative analysis to answer the following four questions: what do AI practitioners understand about the need to translate ethical principles into practice?

These two notions are in apparent tension with each other, and they are present in two lively but largely disconnected debates. In this paper, we aim to further analyse what these calls for transparency entail, and in so doing, clarify the sorts of transparency that we should want from AI systems. We do so by offering a taxonomy that classifies different notions of transparency. After a careful exploration of the different varieties of transparency, we show how this taxonomy can help us to navigate various domains of human–technology interactions, and more usefully discuss the relationship between technological transparency and human agency.

Our results show that documents with stakeholder engagement develop more comprehensive ethical guidance with greater applicability, and that the private sector is least likely to engage stakeholders. We argue that the current trend for enunciating AI ethical guidance not only poses widely discussed challenges of applicability in practice, but also of transparent development (as it rather behaves as a black box) and of active engagement of diversified, independent and trustworthy stakeholders. While most of these documents consider people and the common good as central to their telos, engagement with the general public is significantly lacking.

However, while the debate on fairness in the ethics of artificial intelligence (AI) and in HMLA has grown significantly over the last decade, the very concept of fairness as an ethical value has not yet been sufficiently explored. Our paper aims to fill this gap and address the AI ethics principle of fairness from a conceptual standpoint, drawing insights from accounts of fairness elaborated in moral philosophy and using them to conceptualise fairness as an ethical value and to redefine fairness in HMLA accordingly. To achieve our goal, following a first section aimed at clarifying the background, methodology and structure of the paper, in the second section, we provide an overview of the discussion of the AI ethics principle of fairness in HMLA and show that the concept of fairness underlying this debate is framed in purely distributive terms and overlaps with non-discrimination, which is defined in turn as the absence of biases. After showing that this framing is inadequate, in the third section, we pursue an ethical inquiry into the concept of fairness and argue that fairness ought to be conceived of as an ethical value. Following a clarification of the relationship between fairness and non-discrimination, we show that the two do not overlap and that fairness requires much more than just non-discrimination. Moreover, we highlight that fairness not only has a distributive but also a socio-relational dimension. Finally, we pinpoint the constitutive components of fairness. In doing so, we base our arguments on a renewed reflection on the concept of respect, which goes beyond the idea of equal respect to include respect for individual persons. In the fourth section, we analyse the implications of our conceptual redefinition of fairness as an ethical value in the discussion of fairness in HMLA. Here, we claim that fairness requires more than non-discrimination and the absence of biases as well as more than just distribution; it needs to ensure that HMLA respects persons both as persons and as particular individuals. Finally, in the fifth section, we sketch some broader implications and show how our inquiry can contribute to making HMLA and, more generally, AI promote the social good and a fairer society.",Bias; Discrimination; Ethics of algorithms; Fairness; Healthcare machine-learning algorithms; Respect,,0951-5666,2022-05,2023-11-06 01:29:49,2023-11-06 01:29:49,549–563,,,FVE4E4VS

There is an emerging knowledge base on AI risks to human rights around data security and privacy concerns. A separate strand of work has highlighted the stresses of working in the gig economy. This prevailing focus on human rights and gig impacts has been at the expense of a closer look at how AI may be reshaping traditional workplace relations and, more specifically, workplace health and safety. To address this gap, we outline a conceptual model for developing an AI Work Health and Safety (WHS) Scorecard as a tool to assess and manage the potential risks and hazards to workers resulting from AI use in a workplace. A qualitative, practice-led research study of AI adopters was used to generate and test a novel list of potential AI risks to worker health and safety. Risks were identified after cross-referencing Australian AI Ethics Principles and Principles of Good Work Design with AI ideation, design and implementation stages captured by the AI Canvas, a framework otherwise used for assessing the commercial potential of AI to a business.

We present the results of our study of moral preferences (N = 2769) with respect to three types of AVs: (1) selfish, which protects the lives of passenger(s) over any number of bystanders; (2) altruistic, which minimizes the number of casualties, even if this leads to death of passenger(s); and (3) conservative, which abstains from interfering in such situations. We differentiate between scenarios in which participants are to make their decisions privately or publicly, and for themselves or for their offspring. We aim to answer two research questions: (1) whether the public visibility of the choice of an AV type choice make this choice more altruistic and (2) which type of situation makes it more difficult to choose altruistically: when choosing for society as a whole, when choosing only for oneself, or when choosing only for one’s offspring. Our results show that respondents exhibit a preference for an altruistic strategy for AVs and that it is reinforced when signaled to others. The altruistic preference is strongest when applies to everybody else, weaker when it reflects a solely personal choice, and weakest when choosing for one’s own child.

There is a growing interest in AI by different actors across the continent including scientists, researchers, humanitarian and aid organizations, academic institutions, tech start-ups, and media organizations. Several African states are looking to adopt AI technology to capture economic growth and development opportunities. On the other hand, African researchers highlight the gap in regulatory frameworks and policies that govern the development of AI in the continent. They argue that this could lead to AI technology exacerbating problems of inequalities and injustice in the continent. However, most of the literature on AI ethics is biased toward Euro-American perspectives and lack the understanding of how AI development is apprehended in the Global South, and particularly Africa. Drawing on the case study of the first African Master’s in Machine Intelligence program, this paper argues for looking beyond the question of ethics in AI and examining AI governance issues through the analytical lens of the raciality of computing and the political economy of technoscience to understand AI development in Africa.

Here the actus reus or performative element of the crime is dependent on the mental state or mens rea of the actor. The ability to prosecute these crimes is dependent on the ability to identify and diagnose intentional states in the accused. A certain class of auto didactic algorithmic actor can be given broad objectives without being told how to meet them. Without a definition of intent, they cannot be told not to engage in certain law breaking behaviour nor can they ever be identified as having done it. This ambiguity is neither positive for the owner of the algorithm or for society. The problem exists over and above more familiar debates concerning the eligibility of algorithms for culpability judgements that mens rea is usually associated with.

This is particularly pertinent for AI research and implementation across Africa, a ground where AI systems are and will be used but also a place with a history of imposition of outside values.

In many countries, public debate has focused on the risks this technology poses to privacy, with advocates and experts sounding alarm bells about surveillance and mission creep reminiscent of the post 9/11 era. Yet, when Apple and Google launched their contact tracing API in April 2020, some of the world’s leading privacy experts applauded this initiative for its privacy-preserving technical specifications. In an interesting twist, the tech giants came to be portrayed as greater champions of privacy than some democratic governments. This article proposes to view the Apple/Google API in terms of a broader phenomenon whereby tech corporations are encroaching into ever new spheres of social life. From this perspective, the (legitimate) advantage these actors have accrued in the sphere of the production of digital goods provides them with (illegitimate) access to the spheres of health and medicine, and more worrisome, to the sphere of politics. These sphere transgressions raise numerous risks that are not captured by the focus on privacy harms. Namely, a crowding out of essential spherical expertise, new dependencies on corporate actors for the delivery of essential, public goods, the shaping of (global) public policy by non-representative, private actors and ultimately, the accumulation of decision-making power across multiple spheres.

However, little has been said about the ways in which the normative design choices of app developers, and the products that result therefrom, might contribute to ethical reflection and wider political debate. Drawing from scholarship in critical design and human–computer interaction, this paper examines the development of a QR code-based tracking app called Zwaai (‘Wave’ in Dutch), where its designers explicitly positioned the app as an alternative to the predominant Bluetooth and GPS-based approaches. Through analyzing these designers’ choices, this paper argues that QR code infrastructures can work to surface a set of ethical–political seams, two of which are discussed here—responsibilization and networked (im)permanence—that more ‘seamless’ protocols like Bluetooth actively aim to bypass, and which may go otherwise unnoticed by existing ethical frameworks.",Digital ethics; Contact tracing; Covid-19; Critical design; Seamful infrastructure,,1388-1957,2021-11,2023-11-06 01:30:01,2023-11-06 01:30:01,105–115,,,82JQ9B9D

Drawing from distinct qualitative research approaches, the DEDA framework was developed in an iterative process (2016–2018) and has since then been applied by various Dutch municipalities, the Association of Dutch Municipalities, and the Ministry of General Affairs (NL). We present the DEDA framework as an effective process to moderate case-deliberation and advance the development of responsible data practices. In addition, by thoroughly documenting the deliberation process, the DEDA framework establishes accountability. First, this paper sheds light on the necessity for data ethical case deliberation. Second, it describes the prototypes, the final design of the framework, and its evaluation. After a comparison with other frameworks, and a discussion of the findings, the paper concludes by arguing that the DEDA framework is a useful process for ethical evaluation of data projects for public management and an effective tool for creating awareness of ethical issues in data practices.",Big data; Data ethics; Data-driven public management; Ethical assessment; Information ethics; IoT; Value-sensitive design,,1388-1957,2021-09,2023-11-06 01:29:49,2023-11-06 01:29:49,551–567,,,PEMPIPHN

It is insufficient to look at only the responses and influences of culture on technology without considering how the technology can be adapted in anticipation of, and to support, pluralistic multicultural perspectives in its original design. This goes beyond the simple act of supporting multiple languages and interfaces, but should include the ability of digital and data infrastructure to capture and accommodate pluralistic views, supporting multiple perspectives in the representation and processing of the data itself. In this work, we look at how rethinking the representation of data can allow us to more directly tackle domains that are typically hampered due to intercultural differences, and their inevitable losses in translation, particularly losses of valuable information like context and intention. When we refer to a loss of context and intention, we are referring to the loss of semantic information when practices such as referencing and citation are hard-coded to a particular set of cultural norms. We show that it is possible to expand the way in which we track referential data to capture richer semantic information regarding the contexts and intentions of the creators of this data, and thereby better serve the varied needs of those who consume, study, and refer to such data.

We argue that the appropriate approach is to determine how AIs might fare on a standard account of human moral responsibility: a Strawsonian account. We make no claim that our Strawsonian approach is either the only one worthy of consideration or the obviously correct approach, but we think it is preferable to trying to marry fundamentally different ideas of moral responsibility (i.e. one for AI, one for humans) into a single cohesive account. Under a Strawsonian framework, people are morally responsible when they are appropriately subject to a particular set of attitudes—reactive attitudes—and determine under what conditions it might be appropriate to subject machines to this same set of attitudes. Although the Strawsonian account traditionally applies to individual humans, it is plausible that entities that are not individual humans but possess these attitudes are candidates for moral responsibility under a Strawsonian framework. We conclude that weak AI is never morally responsible, while a strong AI with the right emotional capacities may be morally responsible.",AI ethics; Artificial intelligence; Moral responsibility; Reactive attitude; Strawson,,1388-1957,2021-09,2023-11-06 01:30:01,2023-11-06 01:30:01,483–493,,,B8Z9STDB

Despite these promises, they also bring perils. Using them can inflict unintentional harms on individual human rights. These include the five human rights to work, equality and nondiscrimination, privacy, free expression and free association. Despite the human rights harms of hiring algorithms, the AI ethics literature has predominantly focused on abstract ethical principles. This is problematic for two reasons. First, AI principles have been criticized for being vague and not actionable. Second, the use of vague ethical principles to discuss algorithmic risks does not provide any accountability. This lack of accountability creates an algorithmic accountability gap. Closing this gap is crucial because, without accountability, the use of hiring algorithms can lead to discrimination and unequal access to employment opportunities. This paper makes two contributions to the AI ethics literature. First, it frames the ethical risks of hiring algorithms using international human rights law as a universal standard for determining algorithmic accountability. Second, it evaluates four types of algorithmic impact assessments in terms of how effectively they address the five human rights of job applicants implicated in hiring algorithms.

The opportunity is that now that a spotlight has been switched on the ethical dimensions of CAVs it may be easier to establish a broader debate on ethics of transportation. While the 20 recommendations of the EU report are grouped in three macro-areas: road safety, data ethics, and responsibility, in this paper they will be grouped according to eight philosophical themes: Responsible Innovation, road justice, road safety, freedom, human control, privacy, data fairness, responsibility.

To keep humans actively ‘on’ the decision-making loop and counter overreliance on machines, we propose a ‘reflection machine’ (RM). This system asks users questions about their decision strategy and thereby prompts them to evaluate their own decisions critically. We discuss what forms RMs can take and present a proof-of-concept implementation of a RM that can produce feedback on users’ decisions in the medical and law domains. We show that the prototype requires very little domain knowledge to create reasonably intelligent critiquing questions.

This may explain why some scholars claim that research should focus on rendering AI systems understandable, rather than explainable. Yet, there is a grave lack of agreement concerning these terms in much of the literature on AI. We argue that the seminal distinction made by the philosopher and physician Karl Jaspers between different types of explaining and understanding in psychopathology can be used to promote greater conceptual clarity in the context of Machine Learning (ML). Following Jaspers, we claim that explaining and understanding constitute multi-faceted epistemic approaches that should not be seen as mutually exclusive, but rather as complementary ones as in and of themselves they are necessarily limited. Drawing on the famous example of Watson for Oncology we highlight how Jaspers’ methodology translates to the case of medical AI. Classical considerations from the philosophy of psychiatry can therefore inform a debate at the centre of current AI ethics, which in turn may be crucial for a successful implementation of ethically and legally sound AI in medicine.",,,1388-1957,2022-09,2023-11-06 01:30:04,2023-11-06 01:30:04,,,,4PHV7RN4

To counter this widespread issue, contributions in the literature have proposed fixes that do not consider its systemic character and are based on a top-down, expert-centric governance. To fill this gap, we propose to make use of qualified informed lotteries: a two-step model that transposes the documented benefits of the ancient practice of sortition into the selection of AI ethics boards’ members and combines them with the advantages of a stakeholder-driven, participative, and deliberative bottom-up process typical of Citizens’ Assemblies. The model permits increasing the public’s legitimacy and participation in the decision-making process and its deliverables, curbing the industry’s over-influence and lobbying, and diminishing the instrumentalisation of ethics boards.

I try to make the case for the legal enforcement of a strong explainability requirement: human organizations which decide to automate decision-making should be legally obliged to demonstrate the capacity to explain and justify the algorithmic decisions that have an impact on the wellbeing, rights, and opportunities of those affected by the decisions. This legal duty can be derived from the demands of Rawlsian public reason. In the second part of the paper, I try to show that the argument from the limitations of human cognition fails to get AI off the hook of public reason. Against a growing trend in AI ethics, my main argument is that the analogy between human minds and artificial neural networks fails because it suffers from an atomistic bias which makes it blind to the social and institutional dimension of human reasoning processes. I suggest that developing interpretive AI algorithms is not the only possible answer to the explainability problem; social and institutional answers are also available and in many cases more trustworthy than techno-scientific ones.",AI ethics; Artificial intelligence; Explainability; Cognitive biases; Machine learning; Public reason,,0924-6495,2021-09,2023-11-06 01:29:59,2023-11-06 01:29:59,421–438,,,8MT3MA57

However, there still exists a gap between principles and practices in AI ethics. One major obstacle organisations face when attempting to operationalise AI Ethics is the lack of a well-defined material scope. Put differently, the question to which systems and processes AI ethics principles ought to apply remains unanswered. Of course, there exists no universally accepted definition of AI, and different systems pose different ethical challenges. Nevertheless, pragmatic problem-solving demands that things should be sorted so that their grouping will promote successful actions for some specific end. In this article, we review and compare previous attempts to classify AI systems for the purpose of implementing AI governance in practice. We find that attempts to classify AI systems proposed in previous literature use one of three mental models: the Switch, i.e., a binary approach according to which systems either are or are not considered AI systems depending on their characteristics; the Ladder, i.e., a risk-based approach that classifies systems according to the ethical risks they pose; and the Matrix, i.e., a multi-dimensional classification of systems that take various aspects into account, such as context, input data, and decision-model. Each of these models for classifying AI systems comes with its own set of strengths and weaknesses. By conceptualising different ways of classifying AI systems into simple mental models, we hope to provide organisations that design, deploy, or regulate AI systems with the vocabulary needed to demarcate the material scope of their AI governance frameworks.",Ethics; Artificial intelligence; Governance; Material scope; AI systems; Classification; Mental models,,0924-6495,2023-01,2023-11-06 01:30:01,2023-11-06 01:30:01,221–248,,,JMXN2K4T

There is a significant gap in understanding the impact of current AI technologies on society. For instance, deepfake creates realistic forgeries that make people unable to distinguish reality from fiction, while filtering algorithms distort the perception by amplifying the interests of the user. The speed and scale of the virtual world and its hazy moral context put pressure on regulators to build the groundwork of ethical codes and regulatory frameworks. The multifaceted nature of such regulatory frameworks - legal, technological, societal, political, ethical - make it a challenging task, in which the public perception remains a key issue.The study presents a multimedia art installation - “The Profile”- based on deepfake technologies, in which the users movements are gradually learned and an alter ego is generated. The user becomes confused when this alter ego starts to deviate from its initial mirroring behaviour. “The Profile” artwork aims to raise awareness of the main threats of current online technologies and dark patterns employed online. The users experience ethical dilemmas regarding the impact of the latest technologies in a metaphoric approach. The interaction is structured in three parts that match the steps of creating an online identity: (i) filling personal data, (ii) agreeing to terms and conditions, and (iii) receiving personalised content. Our work extends the current state-of-the-art by using the decomposition of the frame along with the image simplification, real time rendering and the combination of ethics and art for human-centred technology. We also discuss some of the risks of AI, along with the proposal of art as a way to approach technology ethics.

This include both the learning of features from data such as representation learning, and the learning of similarity matching functions from data such as neural function learning. Though many models have been widely used in practical ranking systems such as search and recommendation, their design philosophy limits the models to the correlative signals in data. However, advancing from correlative learning to causal learning in search and recommendation is an important problem, because causal modeling can help us to think outside of the observational data for representation learning and ranking. More specially, causal learning can bring benefits to the IR community on various dimensions, including but not limited to Explainable IR models, Unbiased IR models, Fairness-aware IR models, Robust IR models and Cognitive Reasoning IR models. This workshop focuses on the research and application of causal modeling in search, recommendation and a broader scope of IR tasks.

Nonetheless, we are witnessing a growing allegiance to AI and data ethics in both academia and industry, and purportedly, 200 university curricula claim to have complied with tech ethics [2]. This proliferation is a promising step forward and can be a useful corrective against discriminatory consequences concerning algorithmic systems, particularly in technical fields like CS and AI, where ethical issues are not discursively and normatively foregrounded. However, these efforts are more coordinated with conventional business ethics than more critical traditions of social justice [3] expected to prevail in educational settings [5]. It is required of educational systems to enable students to improve their technological sensibilities and skill sets to generate alternative possibilities that would challenge technocratic ideologies that are uncritical and limit innovation to the measures of efficiency and marketability.Nudged by these concerns and energized by the creative possibilities of a classroom, we realize the integration of the critical and social dimensions of computing technologies into introductory CS courses as a key area of attention and propose a pedagogical approach largely through concepts that have their legacies in intersectional feminist activism, collective organizing [1], and critical theory [4].

Data is thought to be the cornerstone of these trends: where once firms were overwhelmed by large quantities of unused structured and unstructured data, they are increasingly adapting their operations and value creation models, guided both by new digital tools and the data themselves. Website cookies, mobile applications, and surveillance cameras, as well as data from third-party vendors, have thus become the new ""digital oil"", as firms exploit process and customer data in pursuit of digitalization. Established firms' core business models have shifted in response to data availability: Apple Pay and Google Pay (operating systems), AliPay (e-commerce), and Lufthansa's Miles &amp; More purchase enabled loyalty card (travel) emerged from old, established businesses. Still, other firms are partially or wholly digitizing existing business processes in order to respond to the challenges posed by digitalization. Banks, for instance, are using fingerprint and facial recognition to make their services more convenient and to improve security. These developments are not only visible among competitive private sector firms: the public sector is also becoming digitalized, not only to promote efficiency but also to promote transparency and accountability. However, customers and citizens are waking up to the fact that their information is being collected by both private and public entities, and have begun to demand control and transparency. Governments and other regulating bodies (ISO, ACM, and IEEE, among others) are taking a more proactive role in responding to these demands.

However, we claim that the current AI ethics education space relies on a form of ""exclusionary pedagogy,"" where ethics is distilled for computational approaches, but there is no deeper epistemological engagement with other ways of knowing that would benefit ethical thinking or an acknowledgement of the limitations of uni-vocal computational thinking. This results in indifference, devaluation, and a lack of mutual support between CS and humanistic social science (HSS), elevating the myth of technologists as ""ethical unicorns"" that can do it all, though their disciplinary tools are ultimately limited.

But how can it be achieved? Recent work on standards for governable artificial intelligence systems offers a related principle: traceability. Traceability requires establishing not only how a system worked but how it was created and for what purpose, in a way that explains why a system has particular dynamics or behaviors. It connects records of how the system was constructed and what the system did mechanically to the broader goals of governance, in a way that highlights human understanding of that mechanical operation and the decision processes underlying it. We examine the various ways in which the principle of traceability has been articulated in AI principles and other policy documents from around the world, distill from these a set of requirements on software systems driven by the principle, and systematize the technologies available to meet those requirements. From our map of requirements to supporting tools, techniques, and procedures, we identify gaps and needs separating what traceability requires from the toolbox available for practitioners.

Nowadays, the majority of automatic decision making systems are based on data. However, it is well known that machine learning systems can present problematic results if they are built on partial or incomplete data. In fact, in recent years several studies have found a convergence of issues related to the ethics and transparency of these systems in the process of data collection and how they are recorded. Although the process of rigorous data collection and analysis is fundamental in the model design, this step is still largely overlooked by the machine learning community. For this reason, we propose a method of data annotation based on Bayesian statistical inference that aims to warn about the risk of discriminatory results of a given data set. In particular, our method aims to deepen knowledge and promote awareness about the sampling practices employed to create the training set, highlighting that the probability of success or failure conditioned to a minority membership is given by the structure of the data available.

Therefore, it is important to identify and solve the unfairness issues in recommendation scenarios. In this paper, we address the unfairness problem in recommender systems from the user perspective. We group users into advantaged and disadvantaged groups according to their level of activity, and conduct experiments to show that current recommender systems will behave unfairly between two groups of users. Specifically, the advantaged users (active) who only account for a small proportion in data enjoy much higher recommendation quality than those disadvantaged users (inactive). Such bias can also affect the overall performance since the disadvantaged users are the majority. To solve this problem, we provide a re-ranking approach to mitigate this unfairness problem by adding constraints over evaluation metrics. The experiments we conducted on several real-world datasets with various recommendation algorithms show that our approach can not only improve group fairness of users in recommender systems, but also achieve better overall recommendation performance.",AI Ethics; Fairness; Re-ranking; Recommendation System,978-1-4503-8312-7,,2021,2023-11-06 01:30:00,2023-11-06 01:30:00,624–632,WWW '21,Association for Computing Machinery,5CZBLJP5

Several approaches already exist for this purpose, mostly either by reasoning over a set of predefined ethical principles (Top-Down), or by learning new principles (Bottom-Up). While both methods have their own advantages and drawbacks, only few works have explored hybrid approaches, such as using symbolic rules to guide the learning process for instance, combining the advantages of each. This paper draws upon existing works to propose a novel hybrid method using symbolic judging agents to evaluate the ethics of learning agents' behaviors, and accordingly improve their ability to ethically behave in dynamic multi-agent environments. Multiple benefits ensue from this separation between judging and learning agents: agents can evolve (or be updated by human designers) separately, benefiting from co-construction processes; judging agents can act as accessible proxies for non-expert human stakeholders or regulators; and finally, multiple points of view (one per judging agent) can be adopted to judge the behavior of the same agent, which produces a richer feedback. Our proposed approach is applied to an energy distribution problem, in the context of a Smart Grid simulator, with continuous and multi-dimensional states and actions.

Prior work on ""deferral systems"" in classification settings has focused on the setting of a pipeline with a single expert and aimed to accommodate the inaccuracies and biases of this expert to simultaneously learn an inference model and a deferral system. Our work extends this framework to settings where multiple experts are available, with each expert having their own domain of expertise and biases. We propose a framework that simultaneously learns a classifier and a deferral system, with the deferral system choosing to defer to one or more human experts in cases of input where the classifier has low confidence.

Surprisingly, fairness-aware OD has been almost untouched in prior work, as fair machine learning literature mainly focuses on supervised settings. Our work aims to bridge this gap. Specifically, we develop desiderata capturing well-motivated fairness criteria for OD, and systematically formalize the fair OD problem. Further, guided by our desiderata, we propose FairOD, a fairness-aware outlier detector that has the following desirable properties: FairOD (1) exhibits treatment parity at test time, (2) aims to flag equal proportions of samples from all groups (i.e. obtain group fairness, via statistical parity), and (3) strives to flag truly high-risk samples within each group.

In doing so, it departs from much of the explainability literature in law, computer science, philosophy, and the social sciences, which examine the instrumental values that explainable AI has: explainable systems increase accountability and user trust, or reduce the risk of harm due to increased robustness. Think, however, of how you might feel if you went to your local administrative agency to apply for some benefit, or you were handed down a decision by a judge in a court. Let's stipulate that you know that the decision was just, even though neither the civil servant nor the judge explain to you why the decision was made, and you don't know the relevant rules; you just brought all the information you had about yourself, and hoped for the best. Is such a decision process defective? I argue that such a decision process is defective because it prevents individuals from accessing the normative explanations that are necessary to form an appropriate practical orientation towards their social world. A practical orientation is a reflective stance towards one's social world, which is expressed in one's actions and draws on one's cognitive architecture that allows one to navigate the various social practices and institutions. A practical orientation can range from rejection to silent endorsement, and is the sort of attitude for which there are the right kind of reasons, based in the world's normative character. It also determines how one fills out one's role obligations, and, more broadly, guides one's actions in the relevant institution: a teacher in the American South during the time of enforced racial segregation, for example, might choose where to teach on the basis of her rejection of the segregation of education. To form an appropriate practical orientation, one must have an understanding of the social world's normative character, which required a normative explanation And, since we spend so much of our lives at work and are constrained by economic institutions, we must understand their structure and how they function.",alienation; explainable ai; explanation; interpretability; work,978-1-4503-8473-5,,2021,2023-11-06 01:29:51,2023-11-06 01:29:51,266,AIES '21,Association for Computing Machinery,EIHXUHB7

However, many of the critical domains motivating this work are characterized by competitive marketplaces with many decision makers. Realistically, we might expect only a subset of them to adopt any non-compulsory fairness-conscious policy, a situation that political philosophers call partial compliance. This possibility raises important questions: how does partial compliance and the consequent strategic behavior of decision subjects affect the allocation outcomes? If k% of employers were to voluntarily adopt a fairness-promoting intervention, should we expect k% progress (in aggregate) towards the benefits of universal adoption, or will the dynamics of partial compliance wash out the hoped-for benefits? How might adopting a global (versus local) perspective impact the conclusions of an auditor? In this paper, we propose a simple model of an employment market, leveraging simulation as a tool to explore the impact of both interaction effects and incentive effects on outcomes and auditing metrics. Our key findings are that at equilibrium: (1) partial compliance by k% of employers can result in far less than proportional (k%) progress towards the full compliance outcomes; (2) the gap is more severe when fair employers match global (vs local) statistics; (3) choices of local vs global statistics can paint dramatically different pictures of the performance vis-a-vis fairness desiderata of compliant versus non-compliant employers; (4) partial compliance based on local parity measures can induce extreme segregation.

There is concern, however, that these judgements may suffer from explicit or implicit racial bias, as with many other such actions in the criminal justice system. To reduce potential bias in charging decisions, we designed a system that algorithmically redacts race-related information from free-text case narratives. In a first-of-its-kind initiative, we deployed this system at a large American district attorney's office to help prosecutors make race-obscured charging decisions, where it was used to review many incoming felony cases. We report on both the design, efficacy, and impact of our tool for aiding equitable decision-making. We demonstrate that our redaction algorithm is able to accurately obscure race-related information, making it difficult for a human reviewer to guess the race of a suspect while preserving other information from the case narrative. In the jurisdiction we study, we found little evidence of disparate treatment in charging decisions even prior to deployment of our intervention. Thus, as expected, our tool did not substantially alter charging rates.

But it has been difficult to systematically measure the prevalence and placement of cameras, hampering efforts to assess the implications of surveillance on privacy and public safety. Here we present a novel approach for estimating the spatial distribution of surveillance cameras: applying computer vision algorithms to large-scale street view image data. Specifically, we build a camera detection model and apply it to 1.6 million street view images sampled from 10 large U.S. cities and 6 other major cities around the world, with positive model detections verified by human experts. After adjusting for the estimated recall of our model, and accounting for the spatial coverage of our sampled images, we are able to estimate the density of surveillance cameras visible from the road. Across the 16 cities we consider, the estimated number of surveillance cameras per linear kilometer ranges from 0.1 (in Seattle) to 0.9 (in Seoul). In a detailed analysis of the 10 U.S. cities, we find that cameras are concentrated in commercial, industrial, and mixed zones, and in neighborhoods with higher shares of non-white residents—a pattern that persists even after adjusting for land use.

This extends to regulation and ethical discussion of technology and businesses doing data processing. Liberalism relies on the privacy and autonomy of individuals, their ordering through a public market, and, more recently, a measure of equality guaranteed by the state. We argue that these forms of regulation and ethical analysis are largely incompatible with the techno-political and techno-economic dimensions of artificial intelligence. By analyzing liberal regulatory solutions in the form of privacy and data protection, regulation of public markets, and fairness in AI, we expose how the data economy and artificial intelligence have transcended liberal legal imagination. Organizations use artificial intelligence to exceed the bounded rationality of individuals and each other. This has led to the private consolidation of markets and an unequal hierarchy of control operating mainly for the purpose of shareholder value. An artificial intelligence will be only as ethical as the purpose of the social system that operates it. Inspired by the science of artificial life as an alternative to artificial intelligence, we consider data intermediaries: sociotechnical systems composed of individuals associated around collectively pursued purposes.

These practitioners share many of the same ML development difficulties and ethical conundrums as their Big Tech counterparts; however, their experiences are subject to additional under-studied challenges stemming from deploying ML with limited resources, increased existential risk, and absent access to in-house research teams. We contribute a qualitative analysis of 17 interviews with stakeholders from organizations which are less represented in prior studies. We uncover a number of tensions which are introduced or exacerbated by these organizations' resource constraints—tensions between privacy and ubiquity, resource management and performance optimization, and access and monopolization.

However, there has hardly been any focus on precarity which is the term that encapsulates the instability in people's lives. That is, a negative outcome can overspread to other decisions and measures of well-being. Studying precarity necessitates a shift in focus – from the point of view of the decision-maker to the perspective of the decision subject. This centering of the subject is an important direction that unlocks the importance of parting with aggregate measures to examine the long-term effects of decision making. To address this issue, in this paper, we propose a modeling framework that simulates the effects of compounded decision-making on precarity over time. Through our simulations, we are able to show the heterogeneity of precarity by the non-uniform ruinous aftereffects of negative decisions on different income classes of the underlying population and how policy interventions can help mitigate such effects.",algorithmic decision-making; economics; long-term effects; precarity,978-1-4503-8473-5,,2021,2023-11-06 01:29:59,2023-11-06 01:29:59,199–208,AIES '21,Association for Computing Machinery,ZMDWW6HE

However, little is known about its actual implementation. Here, we provide the first comprehensive empirical study of digital blacklists (listing ""bad"" behavior) and redlists (listing ""good"" behavior) in the Chinese SCS. Based on a unique data set of reputational blacklists and redlists in 30 Chinese provincial-level administrative divisions (ADs), we show the diversity, flexibility, and comprehensiveness of the SCS listing infrastructure. First, our results demonstrate that the Chinese SCS unfolds in a highly diversified manner: we find differences in accessibility, interface design and credit information across provincial-level SCS blacklists and redlists. Second, SCS listings are flexible. During the COVID-19 outbreak, we observe a swift addition of blacklists and redlists that helps strengthen the compliance with coronavirus-related norms and regulations. Third, the SCS listing infrastructure is comprehensive. Overall, we identify 273 blacklists and 154 redlists across provincial-level ADs. Our blacklist and redlist taxonomy highlights that the SCS listing infrastructure prioritizes law enforcement and industry regulations. We also identify redlists that reward political and moral behavior.

State-of-the-art neural language models generate dynamic word embeddings dependent on the context in which the word appears. Current methods measure pre-defined social and intersectional biases that occur in contexts defined by sentence templates. Dispensing with templates, we introduce the Contextualized Embedding Association Test (CEAT), that can summarize the magnitude of overall bias in neural language models by incorporating a random-effects model. Experiments on social and intersectional biases show that CEAT finds evidence of all tested biases and provides comprehensive information on the variance of effect magnitudes of the same bias in different contexts. All the models trained on English corpora that we study contain biased representations. GPT-2 contains the smallest magnitude of overall bias followed by GPT, BERT, and then ELMo, negatively correlating with the contextualization levels of the models.Furthermore, we develop two methods, Intersectional Bias Detection (IBD) and Emergent Intersectional Bias Detection (EIBD), to automatically identify the intersectional biases and emergent intersectional biases from static word embeddings in addition to measuring them in contextualized word embeddings. We present the first algorithmic bias detection findings on how intersectional group members are strongly associated with unique emergent biases that do not overlap with the biases of their constituent minority identities.

One strategy for anticipating and addressing ethical challenges related to AI/ML for health care is co-design - or involvement of end users in design. Co-design has a diverse intellectual and practical history, however, and has been conceptualized in many different ways. Moreover, the unique features of AI/ML introduce challenges to co-design that are often underappreciated. This review summarizes the research literature on involvement in health care and design, and informed by critical data studies, examines the extent to which co-design as commonly conceptualized is capable of addressing the range of normative issues raised by AI/ML for health. We suggest that AI/ML technologies have amplified existing challenges related to co-design, and created entirely new challenges. We outline five co-design 'myths and misconceptions' related to AI/ML for health that form the basis for future research and practice. We conclude by suggesting that the normative strength of a co-design approach to AI/ML for health can be considered at three levels: technological, health care system, and societal. We also suggest research directions for a 'new era' of co-design capable of addressing these challenges.Link to full text: https://bit.ly/3yZrb3y",artificial intelligence; ethics; machine learning; co-design; participatory design; health care; health systems,978-1-4503-8473-5,,2021,2023-11-06 01:29:53,2023-11-06 01:29:53,77,AIES '21,Association for Computing Machinery,I8Z639RS

To aid decision-makers in their assessments, institutions increasingly rely on algorithmic risk assessment instruments (RAIs). These tools assess the likelihood that an individual will be arrested for a new criminal offense within some time window following their release. However, since not all crimes result in arrest, RAIs do not directly assess the risk of re-offense. Furthermore, disparities in the likelihood of arrest can potentially lead to biases in the resulting risk scores. Several recent validations of RAIs have therefore focused on arrests for violent offenses, which are viewed as being more accurate and less biased reflections of offending behavior. In this paper, we investigate biases in violent arrest data by analysing racial disparities in the likelihood of arrest for White and Black violent offenders. We focus our study on 2007–2016 incident-level data of violent offenses from 16 US states as recorded in the National Incident Based Reporting System (NIBRS). Our analysis shows that the magnitude and direction of the racial disparities depend on various characteristics of the crimes. In addition, our investigation reveals large variations in arrest rates across geographical locations and offense types. We discuss the implications of the observed disconnect between re-arrest and re-offense in the context of RAIs and the challenges around the use of data from NIBRS to correct for the sampling bias.",crime; nibrs; racial disparity; risk assessment instrument,978-1-4503-8473-5,,2021,2023-11-06 01:29:51,2023-11-06 01:29:51,100–111,AIES '21,Association for Computing Machinery,WJPQ4BSQ

The literature shows that Artificial Intelligence (AI) systems adopting classification models based on time series shapelets can be interpretable, more accurate, and significantly fast. Thus, in order to design a data-agnostic and interpretable classification approach, in this paper we first extend the notion of shapelets to different types of data, i.e., images, tabular and textual data. Then, based on this extended notion of shapelets we propose an interpretable data-agnostic classification method. Since the shapelets discovery can be time consuming, especially for data types more complex than time series, we exploit a notion of prototypes for finding candidate shapelets, and reducing both the time required to find a solution and the variance of shapelets. A wide experimentation on datasets of different types shows that the data-agnostic prototype-based shapelets returned by the proposed method empower an interpretable classification which is also fast, accurate, and stable.

We consider when and why there are trade-offs in machine learning between respecting formalistic interpretations of equal treatment and advancing equality of outcome. Exploring a hypothetical discrimination suit against Facebook, we argue that interpretations of equal treatment which require blindness to difference may constrain how machine learning can be deployed to advance equality of outcome. When machine learning models predict outcomes that are unevenly distributed across racial groups, using those models to advance racial justice will often require deliberately taking race into account. We then explore the normative stakes of this tension. We describe three pragmatic policy options underpinned by distinct interpretations and applications of equal treatment. A status quo approach insists on blindness to difference, permitting the design of machine learning models that compound existing patterns of disadvantage. An industry-led approach would specify a narrow set of domains in which institutions were permitted to use protected characteristics to actively reduce inequalities of outcome. A government-led approach would impose positive duties that require institutions to consider how best to advance equality of outcomes and permit the use of protected characteristics to achieve that goal. We argue that while machine learning offers significant possibilities for advancing racial justice and outcome-based equality, harnessing those possibilities will require a shift in the normative commitments that underpin the interpretation and application of equal treatment in non-discrimination law and the governance of machine learning.",equal treatment; fairness; machine learning; philosophy; politics,978-1-4503-8473-5,,2021,2023-11-06 01:29:51,2023-11-06 01:29:51,956–966,AIES '21,Association for Computing Machinery,HHSDLELN

However, these methods do not directly measure the associations that a model may have learned, for example between labels and identity subgroups. Further, measuring a model's bias requires a fully annotated evaluation dataset which may not be easily available in practice.We present an elegant mathematical solution that tackles both issues simultaneously, using image classification as a working example. By treating a classification model's predictions for a given image as a set of labels analogous to a ""bag of words"", we rank the biases that a model has learned with respect to different identity labels. We use man, woman as a concrete example of an identity label set (although this set need not be binary), and present rankings for the labels that are most biased towards one identity or the other. We demonstrate how the statistical properties of different association metrics can lead to different rankings of the most ""gender biased"" labels, and conclude that normalized pointwise mutual information (nPMI) is most useful in practice.

To promote ethical artificial intelligence, fairness metrics that rely on comparing model error rates across subpopulations have been widely investigated for the detection and mitigation of bias. However, fairness measures that rely on comparing the ability to achieve recourse have been relatively unexplored. In this paper, we present a novel formulation for training neural networks that considers the distance of data observations to the decision boundary such that the new objective: (1) reduces the disparity in the average ability of recourse between individuals in each protected group, and (2) increases the average distance of data points to the boundary to promote adversarial robustness. We demonstrate that models trained with this new objective are more fair and adversarially robust neural networks, with similar accuracies, when compared to models without it. We also investigate a trade-off between the recourse-based fairness and robustness objectives. Moreover, we qualitatively motivate and empirically show that reducing recourse disparity across protected groups also improves fairness measures that rely on error rates.

Lacking transparency, studying such AI systems for fairness and disparate impact has not been possible without access to data used in generating the outcomes of price discrimination algorithms.

In this paper, we argue for considering a complementary form of transparency by estimating and communicating the uncertainty associated with model predictions. First, we discuss methods for assessing uncertainty. Then, we characterize how uncertainty can be used to mitigate model unfairness, augment decision-making, and build trustworthy systems.

In a within-subjects, scenario-based experiment, agents gave suggestions on what to do when entering the building to save a hostage. We analyzed the agent's scores on subjective value similarity, trust and qualitative data from open-ended questions.

We explore a few fairness measures to suss out their egalitarian roots and evaluate them, both as formalizations of egalitarian ideas and as assertions of what fairness demands of predictive systems. We pay special attention to a recent and popular fairness measure, counterfactual fairness, which holds that a prediction about an individual is fair if it is the same in the actual world and any counterfactual world where the individual belongs to a different demographic group (cf.

We show that, while the more fringe topics are more challenging to identify triggers for, they do appear to more effectively discriminate aspects like stance. We view this both as an indication of the dangerous potential for controllability and, perhaps, a reflection of the nature of the disconnect between conflicting views on these topics, something that future work could use to question the nature of filter bubbles and if they are reflected within models trained on internet content.

Impact assessments are often used as instruments to create accountability relationships and grant some measure of agency and voice to communities affected by projects with environmental, financial, and human rights ramifications. Applying these tools-through Algorithmic Impact Assessments (AIA)-is a plausible way to establish accountability relationships for ADSs.

Consequently, numerous studies have explored issues of unfairness against specific groups or individuals in the context of these applications. Much of the previous work on unfairness in machine learning has focused on the fairness of outcomes rather than process. We propose a feature selection method inspired by fair process (procedural fairness) in addition to fair outcome. Specifically, we introduce the notion of unfairness weight, which indicates how heavily to weight unfairness versus accuracy when measuring the marginal benefit of adding a new feature to a model. Our goal is to maintain accuracy while reducing unfairness, as defined by six common statistical definitions. We show that this approach demonstrably decreases unfairness as the unfairness weight is increased, for most combinations of metrics and classifiers used. A small subset of all the combinations of datasets (4), unfairness metrics (6), and classifiers (3), however, demonstrated relatively low unfairness initially. For these specific combinations, neither unfairness nor accuracy were affected as unfairness weight changed, demonstrating that this method does not reduce accuracy unless there is also an equivalent decrease in unfairness.

While work in algorithmic fairness to-date has primarily focused on addressing discrimination due to individually linked attributes, social science research elucidates how some properties we link to individuals can be conceptualized as having causes at macro (e.g. structural) levels, and it may be important to be fair to attributes at multiple levels. For example, instead of simply considering race as a causal, protected attribute of an individual, the cause may be distilled as perceived racial discrimination an individual experiences, which in turn can be affected by neighborhood-level factors. This multi-level conceptualization is relevant to questions of fairness, as it may not only be important to take into account if the individual belonged to another demographic group, but also if the individual received advantaged treatment at the macro-level. In this paper, we formalize the problem of multi-level fairness using tools from causal inference in a manner that allows one to assess and account for effects of sensitive attributes at multiple levels. We show importance of the problem by illustrating residual unfairness if macro-level sensitive attributes are not accounted for, or included without accounting for their multi-level nature. Further, in the context of a real-world task of predicting income based on macro and individual-level attributes, we demonstrate an approach for mitigating unfairness, a result of multi-level sensitive attributes.",fairness; racial justice; social sciences,978-1-4503-8473-5,,2021,2023-11-06 01:29:59,2023-11-06 01:29:59,784–794,AIES '21,Association for Computing Machinery,YLWXARU2

While numerous fairness metrics have been proposed, a comparative analysis to understand their interrelationships is lacking. Even for fundamental statistical parity metrics which measure group advantage, it remains unclear whether metrics measure the same phenomena, or when one metric may produce different results than another. To address these open questions, we formulate a conceptual framework for analytical comparison of metrics. We prove that under reasonable assumptions, popular metrics in the literature exhibit the same behavior and that optimizing for one optimizes for all. However, our analysis also shows that the metrics vary in the degree of unfairness measured, in particular when one group has a strong majority. Based on this analysis, we design a practical statistical test to identify whether observed data is likely to exhibit predictable group bias.

In this paper, we contribute to this line of work by focusing on the representation of age by asking whether older adults are represented proportionally to the population at large in AI data sets. We examine publicly-available information about 92 face data sets to understand how they codify age as a case study to investigate how the subjects' ages are recorded and whether older generations are represented. We find that older adults are very under-represented; five data sets in the study that explicitly documented the closed age intervals of their subjects included older adults (defined as older than 65 years), while only one included oldest-old adults (defined as older than 85 years). Additionally, we find that only 24 of the data sets include any age-related information in their documentation or metadata, and that there is no consistent method followed across these data sets to collect and record the subjects' ages.

Equality or near-equality constraints in group-fairness often worsen not only the aggregate utility but also the utility for the least advantaged sub-population. In this paper, we apply the principles of Pareto-efficiency and least-difference to the utility being accuracy, as an illustrative example, and arrive at the Rawls classifier that minimizes the error rate on the worst-off sensitive sub-population. Our mathematical characterization shows that the Rawls classifier uniformly applies a threshold to an ideal score of features, in the spirit of fair equality of opportunity. In practice, such a score or a feature representation is often computed by a black-box model that has been useful but unfair. Our second contribution is practical Rawlsian fair adaptation of any given black-box deep learning model, without changing the score or feature representation it computes. Given any score function or feature representation and only its second-order statistics on the sensitive sub-populations, we seek a threshold classifier on the given score or a linear threshold classifier on the given feature representation that achieves the Rawls error rate restricted to this hypothesis class. Our technical contribution is to formulate the above problems using ambiguous chance constraints, and to provide efficient algorithms for Rawlsian fair adaptation, along with provable upper bounds on the Rawls error rate.

In this approach, the diversity of users is leveraged in a way that allows like-minded individuals to pursue similar interests or diverse individuals to complement each other in a complex activity. The end users of the envisioned platform are students, who participate in the design process.

This phenomenon can be observed in the yearly records of several real-world datasets, for example, recidivism records and medical expenditure surveys. If unaccounted for, such shifts can cause the predictions of a classifier to become unfair towards specific population subgroups. While the fairness notion called Proportional Equality (PE) accounts for such shifts, a procedure to ensure PE-fairness was unknown. In this work, we design an algorithm, called CAPE, that ensures fair classification under such shifts. We introduce a metric, called prevalence difference, which CAPE attempts to minimize in order to achieve fairness under prior probability shifts. We theoretically establish that this metric exhibits several properties that are desirable for a fair classifier. We evaluate the efficacy of CAPE via a thorough empirical evaluation on synthetic datasets. We also compare the performance of CAPE with several state-of-the-art fair classifiers on real-world datasets like COMPAS (criminal risk assessment) and MEPS (medical expenditure panel survey).

The former assigns an importance score to each input feature, while the latter provides input examples with minimal changes to alter the model's predictions. To unify these approaches, we provide an interpretation based on the actual causality framework and present two key results in terms of their use. First, we present a method to generate feature attribution explanations from a set of counterfactual examples. These feature attributions convey how important a feature is to changing the classification outcome of a model, especially on whether a subset of features is necessary and/or sufficient for that change, which attribution-based methods are unable to provide. Second, we show how counterfactual examples can be used to evaluate the goodness of an attribution-based explanation in terms of its necessity and sufficiency. As a result, we highlight the complimentary of these two approaches. Our evaluation on three benchmark datasets — Adult-Income, LendingClub, and German-Credit — confirms the complimentary. Feature attribution methods like LIME and SHAP and counterfactual explanation methods like Wachter et al. and DiCE often do not agree on feature importance rankings. In addition, by restricting the features that can be modified for generating counterfactual examples, we find that the top-k features from LIME or SHAP are often neither necessary nor sufficient explanations of a model's prediction.

However, there is little to no work that explores whether fair ranking algorithms actually improve real world outcomes (e.g., hiring decisions) for underrepresented groups. Furthermore, there is no clear understanding as to how other factors (e.g., job context, inherent biases of the employers) may impact the efficacy of fair ranking in practice.In this work, we analyze various sources of gender biases in online hiring platforms, including the job context and inherent biases of employers and establish how these factors interact with ranking algorithms to affect hiring decisions.

In a practical setting, we might not be able to jointly observe the covariate and group information, and a standard workaround is to then use proxies for one or more of these variables. Prior works have demonstrated the challenges with using a proxy for sensitive attributes, and strong independence assumptions are needed to provide guarantees on the accuracy of the noisy estimates. In contrast, in this work we study using a proxy for the covariate variable and present a theoretical analysis that aims to characterize weaker conditions under which accurate fairness evaluation is possible. Furthermore, our theory identifies potential sources of errors and decouples them into two interpretable parts y and E. The first part y depends solely on the performance of the proxy such as precision and recall, whereas the second part E captures correlations between all the variables of interest. We show that in many scenarios the error in the estimates is dominated by y via a linear dependence, whereas the dependence on the correlations E only constitutes a lower order term. As a result we expand the understanding of scenarios where measuring model fairness via proxies can be an effective approach. Finally, we compare, via simulations, the theoretical upper-bounds to the distribution of simulated estimation errors and show that assuming some structure on the data, even weak, is key to significantly improve both theoretical guarantees and empirical results.",ml fairness; noisy covariates; statistical parity,978-1-4503-8473-5,,2021,2023-11-06 01:29:56,2023-11-06 01:29:56,873–883,AIES '21,Association for Computing Machinery,FGENC8CU

This paper argues that the effects of data should be understood as a constitutive shift in social and political relations. We explore how datafication, or quantification of human and non-human factors into binary code, affects the identity of individuals and groups. This fundamental shift goes beyond economic and ethical concerns, which has been the focus of other efforts to explore the effects of datafication and AI. We highlight that technologies such as datafication and AI (and previously, the printing press) both disrupted extant power arrangements, leading to decentralization, and triggered a recentralization of power by new actors better adapted to leveraging the new technology. We use the analogy of the printing press to provide a framework for understanding constitutive change. The printing press example gives us more clarity on 1) what can happen when the medium of communication drastically alters how information is communicated and stored; 2) the shift in power from state to private actors; and 3) the tension of simultaneously connecting individuals while driving them towards narrower communities through algorithmic analyses of data.",governance; corporations; politics of data; printing press,978-1-4503-8473-5,,2021,2023-11-06 01:29:53,2023-11-06 01:29:53,864–872,AIES '21,Association for Computing Machinery,FUGR92PF

These considerations have been cashed out as constraints, such that some actions are permissible, while others are impermissible. In this paper, we claim that, in addition to only performing those actions that are permissible, agents should only perform those courses of action that are _unambiguously_ permissible. By doing so they signal normative compliance: they communicate their understanding of, and commitment to abiding by, the normative constraints in play. Those courses of action (or plans) that succeed in signalling compliance in this sense, we term 'acceptable'. The problem this paper addresses is how to compute plans that signal compliance, that is, how to find plans that are acceptable as well as permissible. We do this by identifying those plans such that, were an observer to see only part of its execution, that observer would infer the plan enacted was permissible. This paper provides a formal definition of compliance signalling within the domain of AI planning, describes an algorithm for computing compliance signalling plans, provides preliminary experimental results and discusses possible improvements. The signalling of compliance is vital for communication, coordination and cooperation in situations where the agent is partially observed. It is equally vital, therefore, to solve the computational problem of finding those plans that signal compliance.

Many of its use-cases may also impact the diverse global community as FER becomes embedded into domains ranging from education to security to healthcare. Yet, prior work has highlighted that FER can exhibit both gender and racial biases like other facial analysis techniques. As a result, bias-mitigation research efforts have mainly focused on tackling gender and racial disparities, while other demographic related biases, such as age, have seen less progress. This work seeks to examine the performance of state of the art commercial FER technology on expressive images of men and women from three distinct age groups. We utilize four different commercial FER systems in a black box methodology to evaluate how six emotions - anger, disgust, fear, happiness, neutrality, and sadness - are correctly detected by age group. We further investigate how algorithmic changes over the last year have affected system performance. Our results found that all four commercial FER systems most accurately perceived emotion in images of young adults and least accurately in images of older adults. This trend was observed for analyses conducted in 2019 and 2020. However, little to no gender disparities were observed in either year. While older adults may not have been the initial target consumer of FER technology, statistics show the demographic is quickly growing more keen to applications that use such systems. Our results demonstrate the importance of considering various demographic subgroups during FER system validation and the need for inclusive, intersectional algorithmic developmental practices.",artificial intelligence; age bias; ethical computing; facial emotion recognition; technology audit,978-1-4503-8473-5,,2021,2023-11-06 01:29:53,2023-11-06 01:29:53,638–644,AIES '21,Association for Computing Machinery,D8TLQ2RN

Furthermore, we lay out how AI research has the potential to catalyze social progress by expanding and equalizing capabilities. We show how the capabilities approach aligns with a participatory approach for the design and implementation of AI for social good research in a framework we introduce called PACT, in which community members affected should be brought in as partners and their input prioritized throughout the project.

One of the main barriers is the conventional wisdom that fairness brings a cost in predictive performance metrics such as accuracy which could affect an organization's bottom-line. In this paper we take a closer look at this concern. Clearly fairness/performance trade-offs exist, but are they inevitable? In contrast to the conventional wisdom, we find that it is frequently possible, indeed straightforward, to improve on a trained model's fairness without sacrificing predictive performance. We systematically study the behavior of fair learning algorithms on a range of benchmark datasets, showing that it is possible to improve fairness to some degree with no loss (or even an improvement) in predictive performance via a sensible hyper-parameter selection strategy.

Proponents of individual fairness have argued that it gives the correct definition of algorithmic fairness, and that it should therefore be preferred to other methods for determining fairness. I argue that individual fairness cannot serve as a definition of fairness. Moreover, IF methods should not be given priority over other fairness methods, nor used in isolation from them. To support these conclusions, I describe four in-principle problems for individual fairness as a definition and as a method for ensuring fairness: (1) counterexamples show that similar treatment (and therefore IF) are insufficient to guarantee fairness; (2) IF methods for learning similarity metrics are at risk of encoding human implicit bias; (3) IF requires prior moral judgments, limiting its usefulness as a guide for fairness and undermining its claim to define fairness; and (4) the incommensurability of relevant moral values makes similarity metrics impossible for many tasks. In light of these limitations, I suggest that individual fairness cannot be a definition of fairness, and instead should be seen as one tool among several for ameliorating algorithmic bias.",algorithmic fairness; ethics of AI; incommensurable values; individual fairness,978-1-4503-8473-5,,2021,2023-11-06 01:29:51,2023-11-06 01:29:51,480–490,AIES '21,Association for Computing Machinery,2G6IYAU3

Using interpretive document analysis and analytic tools from the values in design field, we examine how diversity and inclusion work is articulated in public-facing AI ethics documentation produced by three companies that create application and services layer AI infrastructure: Google, Microsoft, and Salesforce.We find that as these documents make diversity and inclusion more tractable to engineers and technical clients, they reveal a drift away from civil rights justifications that resonates with the ""managerialization of diversity"" by corporations in the mid-1980s. The focus on technical artifacts - such as diverse and inclusive datasets - and the replacement of equity with fairness make ethical work more actionable for everyday practitioners. Yet, they appear divorced from broader DEI initiatives and relevant subject matter experts that could provide needed context to nuanced decisions around how to operationalize these values and new solutions. Finally, diversity and inclusion, as configured by engineering logic, positions firms not as ""ethics owners"" but as ethics allocators; while these companies claim expertise on AI ethics, the responsibility of defining who diversity and inclusion are meant to protect and where it is relevant is pushed downstream to their customers.",AI ethics; corporate ethics; DEI; diversity; equity; fairness; human rights; inclusion; law,978-1-4503-8473-5,,2021,2023-11-06 01:29:48,2023-11-06 01:29:48,447–457,AIES '21,Association for Computing Machinery,BWQIFITZ

Algorithmic management promises organizational efficiency, but often undermines worker well-being. How can we computationally model worker well-being so that algorithmic management can be optimized for and assessed in terms of worker well-being? Toward this goal, we propose a participatory approach for worker well-being models. We first define worker well-being models: Work preference models—preferences about work and working conditions, and managerial fairness models—beliefs about fair resource allocation among multiple workers. We then propose elicitation methods to enable workers to build their own well-being models leveraging pairwise comparisons and ranking. As a case study, we evaluate our methods in the context of algorithmic work scheduling with 25 shift workers and 3 managers. The findings show that workers expressed idiosyncratic work preference models and more uniform managerial fairness models, and the elicitation methods helped workers discover their preferences and gave them a sense of empowerment.

However, most of these techniques are specialized to cater to a single family of ML models and a specific definition of fairness, limiting their adaptibility in practice. We introduce a general constrained Bayesian optimization (BO) framework to optimize the performance of any ML model while enforcing one or multiple fairness constraints. BO is a model-agnostic optimization method that has been successfully applied to automatically tune the hyperparameters of ML models. We apply BO with fairness constraints to a range of popular models, including random forests, gradient boosting, and neural networks, showing that we can obtain accurate and fair solutions by acting solely on the hyperparameters. We also show empirically that our approach is competitive with specialized techniques that enforce model-specific fairness constraints, and outperforms preprocessing methods that learn fair representations of the input data. Moreover, our method can be used in synergy with such specialized fairness techniques to tune their hyperparameters. Finally, we study the relationship between fairness and the hyperparameters selected by BO. We observe a correlation between regularization and unbiased models, explaining why acting on the hyperparameters leads to ML models that generalize well and are fair.",fairness; bias; autoML; Bayesian optimization; hyperparameter tuning,978-1-4503-8473-5,,2021,2023-11-06 01:29:57,2023-11-06 01:29:57,854–863,AIES '21,Association for Computing Machinery,B3R69JDY

In other words, our proposal calls for ignoring the errors that occur due to uncertainty inherent in the data, i.e., aleatoric uncertainty. We draw a connection between predictive multiplicity and model uncertainty and argue that the techniques from predictive multiplicity could be used to identify errors made due to model uncertainty. We propose scalable convex proxies to come up with classifiers that exhibit predictive multiplicity and empirically show that our methods are comparable in performance and up to four orders of magnitude faster than the current state-of-the-art.

We introduce Lean Privacy Review (LPR), a fast, cheap, and easy-to-access method to help practitioners collect direct feedback from users through the proxy of crowd workers in the early stages of design. LPR takes a proposed data practice, quickly breaks it down into smaller parts, generates a set of questionnaire surveys, solicits users’ opinions, and summarizes those opinions in a compact form for practitioners to use. By doing so, LPR can help uncover the range and magnitude of different privacy concerns actual people have at a small fraction of the cost and wait-time for a formal review. We evaluated LPR using 12 real-world data practices with 240 crowd users and 24 data practitioners. Our results show that (1) the discovery of privacy concerns saturates as the number of evaluators exceeds 14 participants, which takes around 5.5 hours to complete (i.e., latency) and costs 3.7 hours of total crowd work ( $80 in our experiments); and (2) LPR finds 89% of privacy concerns identified by data practitioners as well as 139% additional privacy concerns that practitioners are not aware of, at a 6% estimated false alarm rate.",data ethics; heuristic evaluation; Privacy concern; privacy engineering,,1073-0516,2021-08,2023-11-06 01:30:02,2023-11-06 01:30:02,,,,ASW3V8FI

The potential commercial applications of this technology are widely acknowledged, particularly in the context of social media. Yet, little is known about data subjects' conceptualizations of and attitudes toward automatic ER-enabled wellbeing interventions. To address this gap, we interviewed 13 US adult social media data subjects regarding social media-based automatic ER-enabled wellbeing interventions. We found that participants' attitudes toward automatic ER-enabled wellbeing interventions were predominantly negative. Negative attitudes were largely shaped by how participants compared their conceptualizations of Artificial Intelligence (AI) to the humans that traditionally deliver wellbeing support. Comparisons between AI and human wellbeing interventions were based upon human attributes participants doubted AI could hold: 1) helpfulness and authentic care; 2) personal and professional expertise; 3) morality; and 4) benevolence through shared humanity. In some cases, participants' attitudes toward automatic ER-enabled wellbeing interventions shifted when participants conceptualized automatic ER-enabled wellbeing interventions' impact on others, rather than themselves. Though with reluctance, a minority of participants held more positive attitudes toward their conceptualizations of automatic ER-enabled wellbeing interventions, citing their potential to benefit others: 1) by supporting academic research; 2) by increasing access to wellbeing support; and 3) through egregious harm prevention. However, most participants anticipated harms associated with their conceptualizations of automatic ER-enabled wellbeing interventions for others, such as re-traumatization, the spread of inaccurate health information, inappropriate surveillance, and interventions informed by inaccurate predictions. Lastly, while participants had qualms about automatic ER-enabled wellbeing interventions, we identified three development and delivery qualities of automatic ER-enabled wellbeing interventions upon which their attitudes toward them depended: 1) accuracy; 2) contextual sensitivity; and 3) positive outcome. Our study is not motivated to make normative statements about whether or how automatic ER-enabled wellbeing interventions should exist, but to center voices of the data subjects affected by this technology. We argue for the inclusion of data subjects in the development of requirements for ethical and trustworthy ER applications. To that end, we discuss ethical, social, and policy implications of our findings, suggesting that automatic ER-enabled wellbeing interventions imagined by participants are incompatible with aims to promote trustworthy, socially aware, and responsible AI technologies in the current practical and regulatory landscape in the US.",AI ethics; ethics; fairness; emotion recognition; affect recognition; affective computing; algorithmic accountability; artificial emotional intelligence; emotion ai; social media; wellbeing interventions,,,2021-10,2023-11-06 01:30:02,2023-11-06 01:30:02,,,,YS9GKVKD

AI + Dance: Co-Designing Culturally Sustaining Curricular Resources for AI and Ethics Education Through Artistic Computing,Proceedings of the 2022 ACM Conference on International Computing Education Research - Volume 2,,,10.1145/3501709.3544275,"Castro, Francisco Enrique Vicente; DesPortes, Kayla; Payne, William; Bergner, Yoav; McDermott, Kathleen",2022,https://doi.org/10.1145/3501709.3544275,conferencePaper,"Artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) systems are ubiquitous across many fields ranging from medicine (e.g., tumor detection), to natural language processing (e.g., digital home assistants, auto-translate tools), and personalization (e.g., social media recommendations). The rise of these systems has also seen a rise in the ethical challenges resulting from how some of these systems are designed and implemented. Most problematic is their propagation and amplification of problems such as racism and sexism [4, 6], among others. Further, these challenges exist within a computing discipline that is already burdened by exclusive, marginalizing cultures and practices that lead to low participation by women and Black, Indigenous, and People of Color (BIPOC) [3]. Our project, AI + Dance, attends to these dimensions of inequity within AI/ML education through developing our understanding of how we can equip learners to recognize and rectify issues of AI and ML systems within an inclusive and culturally sustaining experience. We explore this in collaboration with STEM From Dance1 (SFD), a non-profit organization that supports girls of color in creative production with dance, CS, and STEM. In our prior work with SFD, we developed danceON, an open-access creative coding environment that enables learners to create code to engage authentically with dance and body motion [5]. With danceON, learners can code animations that can bind and respond to body positions and be statically and dynamically positioned in space. The system provides two ways to explore AI and ML. First, it integrates a pose detection machine learning model (PoseNet [8]) that consists of body points (i.e., Left Ear, Nose, etc.) and confidence scores for these key points, which are all accessible within the code. Second, danceON enables learners to import a model trained in Google’s Teachable Machine [2] to access the probabilistic classifier to manipulate and trigger animations. While we have explored the use of danceON to enable learners to build culturally relevant artistic artifacts [5], we have yet to explore how we can teach AI and ML concepts and ethics through the use of the system. We investigate two research questions through the co-design of culturally sustaining AI/ML resources with teachers: RQ1) How can we authentically build on learners’ identities, cultural knowledge, and practices with dance as they build, explore, and critique ML and AI models and systems? RQ2) How can we leverage learners’ creative, embodied experiences with ML and AI to facilitate reflection and critique of CS and AI/ML within their communities and society more broadly? We focus on co-design as a method that facilitates sustainability through centering teachers’ values, ownership, and authentic contexts in the realization, implementation, and evaluation of learning designs [7]. Through co-designing curricular resources, we will develop a set of modules aligned with the AI4K12 guidelines [1] that builds our understanding of creating culturally sustaining educational resources to teach about AI and ethical design in ways that leverage the culturally situated, collaborative, and embodied nature of dance.",AI ethics; Artificial intelligence; Machine learning; Artistic computing; Creative computing; Dance; danceON,978-1-4503-9195-5,,2022,2023-11-06 01:30:01,2023-11-06 01:30:01,26–27,ICER '22,Association for Computing Machinery,QBTM5LLM

However, building a curriculum that introduces AI content to K-12 students present significant challenges, such as connecting to prior knowledge, and developing curricula that are meaningful for students and possible for teachers to teach. To lay the groundwork for elementary AI education, we conducted a qualitative study into the design of AI curricular approaches with elementary teachers and students.

Although such ‘visually available’ information can enhance one’s social interactions, the privacy and ethical implications for automated judgments about bystanders, especially from the perspective of PVIs, remains underexplored. To study the concerns of both bystanders and PVIs with such technologies, we conducted two online surveys with visually impaired participants as wearers (N = 128) and sighted participants as bystanders (N = 136). Although PVIs found some types of information to be improper or impolite (such as someone’s weight), our overarching finding is the shared ethical concern between PVIs and bystanders related to the fallibility of AI, in which bystanders can be misrepresented (algorithmically) by the devices. These mischaracterizations can range from occasional unexpected algorithmic errors (e.g., errors in facial recognition) to the questionable use of AI for determining subjective social constructs (such as gender).

Despite technological improvements, AI systems are fallible and may err. How do consumers respond when learning of AI's failures? In thirteen preregistered studies (N = 3,724), we document a robust effect of algorithmic transference: algorithmic failures are generalized more broadly than human failures. Rather than reflecting generalized algorithm aversion, algorithmic transference is rooted in social categorization: it stems from how people perceive a group of AI systems versus a group of humans—as outgroups characterized by greater homogeneity than ingroups of comparable humans. Because AI systems are perceived as more homogeneous than people, failure information about one AI algorithm is transferred to another algorithm at a higher rate than failure information about a person is transferred to another person. Assessing AI's impact on consumers and societies, we show how the premature or mismanaged deployment of faulty AI technologies may engender algorithmic transference and undermine the very institutions that AI systems are meant to modernize.",artificial intelligence; public policy; algorithm; government; social impact,978-1-4503-9247-1,,2022,2023-11-06 01:29:56,2023-11-06 01:29:56,446,AIES '22,Association for Computing Machinery,CYJF5W7T

But when given biased historical data, these algorithms can quickly become discriminatory. The area of machine learning fairness has emerged to detect and de-bias these algorithms, but has received widespread criticism for its one-size-fits-all approach, which allows certain cases of bias to slip through the cracks. In this study, we take a deeper look at the mechanisms by which machine learning algorithms develop harmful bias. We introduce a new method to interpret discriminatory systems, an Evolutionary algorithm for Feature Interaction (EFI), which we apply to several commonly used machine learning algorithms in two real-world problem instances: violent crime and median house price prediction. In the results, we discover several complex forms of bias including the encoding of race through other seemingly unrelated attributes. Ultimately we suggest that more informative interpretation tools such as EFI can be used to not only explain machine learning outcomes, but supplement and improve existing machine bias detection approaches to provide a more robust and in-depth ethical evaluation of machine learning algorithms.",fairness; interpretability; feature importance; feature interaction; machine bias,978-1-4503-9247-1,,2022,2023-11-06 01:29:52,2023-11-06 01:29:52,588–598,AIES '22,Association for Computing Machinery,IGFK4UZX

In this work, we ask a complementary question: can AI-based decisions be designed to dynamically influence the evolution of fairness in our society over the long term? To explore this question, we propose a framework for sequential decision-making aimed at dynamically influencing long-term societal fairness, illustrated via the problem of selecting applicants from a pool consisting of two groups, one of which is under-represented. We consider a dynamic model for the composition of the applicant pool, in which admission of more applicants from a group in a given selection round positively reinforces more candidates from the group to participate in future selection rounds. Under such a model, we show the efficacy of the proposed Fair-Greedy selection policy which systematically trades the sum of the scores of the selected applicants (""greedy”) against the deviation of the proportion of selected applicants belonging to a given group from a target proportion (""fair”). In addition to experimenting on synthetic data, we adapt static real-world datasets on law school candidates and credit lending to simulate the dynamics of the composition of the applicant pool. We prove that the applicant pool composition converges to a target proportion set by the decision-maker when score distributions across the groups are identical.",ai for social equity; fair selection; long-term fairness; positive reinforcement; sequential decision-making,978-1-4503-9247-1,,2022,2023-11-06 01:29:54,2023-11-06 01:29:54,547–556,AIES '22,Association for Computing Machinery,YW5C3BYB

In fact, reports about privacy violations in SPAs and associated user concerns are well known and understood in the related literature. It is difficult for SPAs to automatically decide how data should be shared with respect to the privacy preferences of the users. We argue norms, which are regarded as shared standards of acceptable behaviour of groups and/or individuals, can be used to govern and reason about the best course of action of SPAs with regards to information sharing, and our work is the first to propose a practical model to address the above issues and govern SPAs based on normative systems and the contextual integrity theory of privacy.

Unfortunately, the profit motive is often misaligned with this goal. Successful work to identify or reduce risk rarely has direct tangible benefits. In this paper, we consider the use of regulatory penalty defaults as a way to counter these perverse incentives. A regulatory penalty default regime consists of two parts: a regulatory penalty default and a mechanism to bargain around the default. The regulatory penalty default induces private actors to research and mitigate potential harms in order to limit liability, making the benefits of risk mitigation tangible. The bargaining mechanism provides incentives for companies to go beyond achieving a prescriptive threshold of compliance in creating a compelling case for escape from the default. With a focus on the policy landscape in the United States, we propose and discuss potential regulatory penalty default regimes for AI systems. For each of our proposals, we also discuss accompanying regulatory pathways for the bargaining process.

In this paper, we investigate how to allocate limited resources to locally interacting communities in a way to maximize a pertinent notion of equitability. In particular, we look at the dynamic setting where the allocation is repeated across multiple periods (e.g., yearly), the local communities evolve in the meantime (driven by the provided allocation), and the allocations are modulated by feedback coming from the communities themselves. We employ recent mathematical tools stemming from data-driven feedback online optimization, by which communities can learn their (possibly unknown) evolution, satisfaction, as well as they can share information with the deciding bodies. We design dynamic policies that converge to an allocation that maximize equitability in the long term. We further demonstrate our model and methodology with realistic examples of healthcare and education subsidies design in Sub-Saharian countries. One of the key empirical takeaways from our setting is that long-term equitability is fragile, in the sense that it can be easily lost when deciding bodies weigh in other factors (e.g., equality in allocation) in the allocation strategy.

Actual Causality and Responsibility Attribution in Decentralized Partially Observable Markov Decision Processes,"Proceedings of the 2022 AAAI/ACM Conference on AI, Ethics, and Society",,,10.1145/3514094.3534133,"Triantafyllou, Stelios; Singla, Adish; Radanovic, Goran",2022,https://doi.org/10.1145/3514094.3534133,conferencePaper,"Actual causality and a closely related concept of responsibility attribution are central to accountable decision making. Actual causality focuses on specific outcomes and aims to identify decisions (actions) that were critical in realizing an outcome of interest. Responsibility attribution is complementary and aims to identify the extent to which decision makers (agents) are responsible for this outcome. In this paper, we study these concepts under a widely used framework for multi-agent sequential decision making under uncertainty: decentralized partially observable Markov decision processes (Dec-POMDPs). Following recent works in RL that show correspondence between POMDPs and Structural Causal Models (SCMs), we first establish a connection between Dec-POMDPs and SCMs. This connection enables us to utilize a language for describing actual causality from prior work and study existing definitions of actual causality in Dec-POMDPs. Given that some of the well-known definitions may lead to counter-intuitive actual causes, we introduce a novel definition that more explicitly accounts for causal dependencies between agents' actions. We then turn to responsibility attribution based on actual causality, where we argue that in ascribing responsibility to an agent it is important to consider both the number of actual causes in which the agent participates, as well as its ability to manipulate its own degree of responsibility. Motivated by these arguments we introduce a family of responsibility attribution methods that extends prior work, while accounting for the aforementioned considerations. Finally, through a simulation-based experiment, we compare different definitions of actual causality and responsibility attribution methods. The empirical results demonstrate the qualitative difference between the considered definitions of actual causality and their impact on attributed responsibility.",actual causality; multi-agent systems; responsibility attribution,978-1-4503-9247-1,,2022,2023-11-06 01:29:57,2023-11-06 01:29:57,739–752,AIES '22,Association for Computing Machinery,TUFCFVX2

Embedding association tests (EATs) using standardized images of self-identified Asian, Black, Latina/o, and White individuals from the Chicago Face Database (CFD) reveal that White individuals are more associated with collective in-group words than are Asian, Black, or Latina/o individuals, with effect sizes &gt;.4 for White vs. Asian comparisons across all models. In assessments of three core aspects of American identity reported by social psychologists, single-category EATs reveal that images of White individuals are more associated with patriotism and with being born in America, but that, consistent with prior findings in psychology, White individuals are associated with being less likely to treat people of all races and backgrounds equally. Additional tests reveal that the number of images of Black individuals returned by an image ranking task is more strongly correlated with state-level implicit bias scores for White individuals (Pearson's ρ=.63 in CLIP, ρ=.69 in BLIP) than are state demographics (ρ=.60), suggesting a relationship between regional prototypicality and implicit bias. Three downstream machine learning tasks demonstrate biases associating American with White. In a visual question answering task using BLIP, 97% of White individuals are identified as American, compared to only 3% of Asian individuals. When asked in what state the individual depicted lives in, the model responds China 53% of the time for Asian individuals, but always with an American state for White individuals. In an image captioning task, BLIP remarks upon the race of Asian individuals as much as 36% of the time, and the race of Black individuals as much as 18% of the time, but never remarks upon race for White individuals.

Leveraging a theoretical lens for how organizations change, we conducted semi-structured interviews with 23 entrepreneurs working at early-stage AI startups. We find that actors within startups both conform to and resist institutional pressures. Our analysis identifies a central tension for AI entrepreneurs: they often valued scientific integrity and methodological rigor; however, influential external stakeholders either lacked the technical knowledge to appreciate entrepreneurs' emphasis on rigor or were more focused on business priorities. As a result, entrepreneurs adopted hyped marketing messages about AI that diverged from their scientific values, but attempted to preserve their legitimacy internally. Institutional pressures and organizational constraints also influenced entrepreneurs' modeling practices and their response to actual or impending regulation.

In particular, we suggest that the AMA at its current conception is fundamentally misaligned with human moral psychology - it incorrectly assumes a static moral values framework underpinning the AMA's attunement to individual users, and people's reactions and subsequent (in)actions in response to the AMA suggestions will likely diverge substantially from expectations.

To reduce the amount of online biased language, one critical first step is to accurately detect such biased language, ideally automatically. This is a challenging problem, however, as the annotated data necessary for training a biased language classifier is either scarce and costly (e.g., when collected from experts), or noisy and potentially biased on their own (e.g., when collected from crowd workers). The biased language classifier built based on these annotations may thus be inaccurate, and sometimes unfair (e.g., have systematic accuracy disparities across texts with different political leanings). In this paper, we propose a novel method, CLEARE, for biased language detection, in which we utilize self-supervised contrastive learning to enhance the biased language classifier—we learn a robust encoder of the textual data through solving a min-max optimization problem, so that the encoder could help achieve the best classification performance even if the worst data augmentation strategy is selected.

There have been attempts to account for fairness of AI algorithms without compromising their accuracy to improve poorly designed algorithms that disregard sensitive attributes (e.g., age, race, and gender) at the peril of introducing or increasing bias against specific groups. Although many studies have examined the optimal trade-off between fairness and accuracy, it remains a challenge to understand the sources of unfairness in decision-making and mitigate it effectively. To tackle this problem, researchers have proposed fair causal learning approaches which assist us in modeling cause and effect knowledge structures, discovering bias sources, and refining AI algorithms to make them more transparent and explainable. In this study, we formalize probabilistic interpretations of both contrastive and counterfactual causality as essential features in order to encourage users' trust and to expand the applicability of such automated systems. We use this formalism to define a novel fairness criterion that we call contrastive counterfactual fairness. This paper introduces, to the best of our knowledge, the first probabilistic fairness-aware data augmentation approach that is based on contrastive counterfactual causality.

In this paper, we recruited over 1100 crowdworkers to characterize how humans use AI suggestions relative to equivalent suggestions from a group of peer humans across several experimental settings. We find that participants' beliefs about how human versus AI performance on a given task affects whether they heed the advice.

"Does AI De-Bias Recruitment?

We argue that these claims are misleading for four reasons: First, attempts to 'strip' gender and race from AI systems often misunderstand what gender and race are, casting them as isolatable attributes rather than broader systems of power. Second, the attempted outsourcing of 'diversity work' to AI-powered hiring tools may unintentionally entrench cultures of inequality and discrimination by failing to address the systemic problems within organizations. Third, AI hiring tools' supposedly neutral assessment of candidates' traits belies the power relationship between the observer and the observed. Specifically, the racialized history of character analysis and its associated processes of classification and categorisation play into longer histories of taxonomical sorting and reflect the current demands and desires of the job market, even when not explicitly conducted along the lines of gender and race. Fourth, recruitment AI tools help produce the 'ideal candidate' that they supposedly identify through by constructing associations between words and people's bodies. From these four conclusions outlined above, we offer three key recommendations to AI HR firms, their customers, and policy makers going forward.",ai ethics; bias; gender; race; recruitment,978-1-4503-9247-1,,2022,2023-11-06 01:29:49,2023-11-06 01:29:49,237,AIES '22,Association for Computing Machinery,PCEG5HCT

Recent studies have shown that many computer vision models and datasets exhibit demographic biases and proposed mitigation strategies. These works attempt to address accuracy disparity, spurious correlations, or unbalanced representations in datasets in tasks such as face recognition, verification and expression and attribute classification. These tasks, however, all require face detection as the first preprocessing step, and surprisingly, there has been little effort in identifying or mitigating biases in face detection. Biased face detectors themselves pose a threat against fair and ethical AI systems, and their biases may be further passed on to subsequent downstream tasks such as face recognition in a computer vision pipeline. This paper therefore investigates the problem of biases in face detection, focusing on accuracy disparity of detectors between demographic groups including gender, age group, and skin tone. We collect perceived demographic attributes on a popular face detection benchmark dataset, WIDER FACE, report skewed demographic distributions, and compare detection performance between groups. In order to mitigate the biases, we apply three mitigation methods that have been introduced in the recent literature and also propose two novel methods. Experimental results show that these methods are effective in reducing demographic biases. We also discuss how the effectiveness varies by demographic attributes, detection easiness, and multiple detectors, which will shed light on this new topic of addressing face detection bias.",bias measurement and mitigation; face detection bias; fairness in computer vision,978-1-4503-9247-1,,2022,2023-11-06 01:29:56,2023-11-06 01:29:56,813–822,AIES '22,Association for Computing Machinery,EMY32QI2

In the US, there are laws in place to make sure discrimination does not happen in lending and agencies charged with enforcing them. However, conversations around fair credit models in computer science and in policy are often misaligned: fair machine learning research often lacks legal and practical considerations specific to existing fair lending policy, and regulators have yet to issue new guidance on how, if at all, credit risk models should be utilizing practices and techniques from the research community.

In this work, we initiate the study of identifying group-based disparities in explanation quality. To this end, we first outline several key properties that contribute to explanation quality-namely, fidelity (accuracy), stability, consistency, and sparsity-and discuss why and how disparities in these properties can be particularly problematic. We then propose an evaluation framework which can quantitatively measure disparities in the quality of explanations. Using this framework, we carry out an empirical analysis with three datasets, six post hoc explanation methods, and different model classes to understand if and when group-based disparities in explanation quality arise. Our results indicate that such disparities are more likely to occur when the models being explained are complex and non-linear. We also observe that certain post hoc explanation methods (e.g., Integrated Gradients, SHAP) are more likely to exhibit disparities.

More specifically, it presents the preliminary results of a qualitative frame analysis of 90 policy documents published by experts from industry, civil society, and the research community. The analysis finds that AI expertise is a highly contested field, as experts not only disagree on why AI is problematic and what policies are required, but, more fundamentally, about which artifacts, ideas, and practices make up AI in the first place. The paper proposes that the epistemic disagreements concerning AI have political consequences, as they engender protracted ontological politics that jeopardize the development of effective governance interventions.

The statistical regularities in language corpora encode well-known social biases into word embeddings (e.g., the word vector for family is closer to the vector women than to men). Although efforts have been made to mitigate bias in word embeddings, with the hope of improving fairness in downstream Natural Language Processing (NLP) applications, these efforts will remain limited until we more deeply understand the multiple (and often subtle) ways that social biases can be reflected in word embeddings. Here, we focus on gender to provide a comprehensive analysis of group-based biases in widely-used static English word embeddings trained on internet corpora (GloVe 2014, fastText 2017). While some previous research has helped uncover biases in specific semantic associations between a group and a target domain (e.g., women - family), using the Single-Category Word Embedding Association Test, we demonstrate the widespread prevalence of gender biases that also show differences in: (1) frequencies of words associated with men versus women; (b) part-of-speech tags in gender-associated words; (c) semantic categories in gender-associated words; and (d) valence, arousal, and dominance in gender-associated words. We leave the analysis of non-binary gender to future work due to the challenges in accurate group representation caused by limitations inherent in data.First, in terms of word frequency: we find that, of the 1,000 most frequent words in the vocabulary, 77% are more associated with men than women, providing direct evidence of a masculine default in the everyday language of the English-speaking world. Second, turning to parts-of-speech: the top male-associated words are typically verbs (e.g., fight, overpower) while the top female-associated words are typically adjectives and adverbs (e.g., giving, emotionally). Gender biases in embeddings also permeate parts-of-speech. Third, for semantic categories: bottom-up, cluster analyses of the top 1,000 words associated with each gender. The top male-associated concepts include roles and domains of big tech, engineering, religion, sports, and violence; in contrast, the top female-associated concepts are less focused on roles, including, instead, female-specific slurs and sexual content, as well as appearance and kitchen terms. Fourth, using human ratings of word valence, arousal, and dominance from a 20,000 word lexicon, we find that male-associated words are higher on arousal and dominance, while female-associated words are higher on valence. Ultimately, these findings move the study of gender bias in word embeddings beyond the basic investigation of semantic relationships to also study gender differences in multiple manifestations in text. Given the central role of word embeddings in NLP applications, it is essential to more comprehensively document where biases exist and may remain hidden, allowing them to persist without our awareness throughout large text corpora.",ai bias; gender bias; masculine default; psycholinguistics; representation; word embeddings,978-1-4503-9247-1,,2022,2023-11-06 01:29:51,2023-11-06 01:29:51,156–170,AIES '22,Association for Computing Machinery,7A6C99XB

An RL agent takes actions by following a utility-maximizing policy. We maintain that the choice of utility function embeds ethical and social values implicitly, and that it is necessary to make these values explicit. This work provides a basis for doing so. First, we propose a probabilistic deontic logic that is suited for formally specifying the obligations of a stochastic system, including its ethical obligations. We prove some useful validities about this logic, and how its semantics are compatible with those of Markov Decision Processes (MDPs). Second, we show that model checking allows us to prove that an agent has a given obligation to bring about some state of affairs - meaning that by acting optimally, it is seeking to reach that state of affairs. We develop a model checker for our logic against MDPs. Third, we observe that it is useful for a system designer to obtain a logical characterization of her system's obligations, which is potentially more interpretable and helpful in debugging than the expression of a utility function. Enumerating all the obligations of an agent is impractical, so we propose a Bayesian optimization routine that learns to generate a system's obligations that the system designer deems interesting. We implement the model checking and Bayesian optimization routines, and demonstrate their effectiveness with an initial pilot study.

To address this gap, we present a heuristic map which matches human cognitive biases with explainability techniques from the XAI literature, structured around XAI-aided decision-making. We identify four main ways cognitive biases affect or are affected by XAI systems: 1) cognitive biases affect how XAI methods are designed, 2) they can distort how XAI techniques are evaluated in user studies, 3) some cognitive biases can be successfully mitigated by XAI techniques, and, on the contrary, 4) some cognitive biases can be exacerbated by XAI techniques. We construct this heuristic map through the systematic review of 37 papers-drawn from a corpus of 285-that reveal cognitive biases in XAI systems, including the explainability method and the user and task types in which they arise.

Meanwhile, involving AI in these high-stake decisions has created ethical concerns on how to balance different trade-offs to respect human values. One approach for aligning AIs with human values is to elicit human ethical preferences and incorporate this information in the design of computer systems. In this work, we explore how human ethical preferences are impacted by the information shown to humans during elicitation. In particular, we aim to provide a contrast between verifiable information (e.g., patient demographics or blood test results) and predictive information (e.g., the probability of organ transplant success).

While others have studied the importance of data, hardware, and models in directing the trajectory of AI, we argue that open source software is a neglected factor shaping AI as a discipline. We start with the observation that almost all AI research and applications are built on machine learning open source software (MLOSS). This paper presents three contributions. First, it quantifies the outsized impact of MLOSS by using Github contributions data. By contrasting the costs of MLOSS and its economic benefits, we find that the average dollar of MLOSS investment corresponds to at least 100 of global economic value created, corresponding to 30B of economic value created this year. Second, we leverage interviews with AI researchers and developers to develop a causal model of the effect of open sourcing on economic value. We argue that open sourcing creates value through three primary mechanisms: standardization of MLOSS tools, increased experimentation in AI research, and creation of communities. Finally, we consider the incentives for developing MLOSS and the broader implications of these effects.

In this paper, we propose a causal framework that learns optimal intervention policies from data subject to novel fairness constraints. We define two measures of treatment bias and infer treatment assignments that minimize the bias against protected groups while optimizing overall outcomes. We demonstrate the existence of trade-offs when balancing fairness and overall benefit; however, allowing preferential treatment of protected groups in certain circumstances (affirmative action) can dramatically improve the overall benefit while also preserving fairness.

Yet recommender systems constitute dynamical systems with feedback loops from the recommendations to the underlying population distributions which could lead to unforeseen and adverse consequences if not taken into account. In this paper, we study a connection recommender system patterned after the systems employed by web-scale social networks and analyze the long-term effects of intervening on fairness in the recommendations.

In general, how should we account for and balance the ethical values, safety recommendations, and societal norms, when we are trying to achieve a certain objective? To enable effective AI-human collaboration, we must equip AI agents with a model of how humans make such trade-offs in environments where there is not only a goal to be reached, but there are also ethical constraints to be considered and to possibly align with. These ethical constraints could be both deontological rules on actions that should not be performed, or also consequentialist policies that recommend avoiding reaching certain states of the world. Our purpose is to build AI agents that can mimic human behavior in these ethically constrained decision environments, with a long term research goal to use AI to help humans in making better moral judgments and actions. To this end, we propose a computational approach where competing objectives and ethical constraints are orchestrated through a method that leverages a cognitive model of human decision making, called multi-alternative decision field theory (MDFT). Using MDFT, we build an orchestrator, called MDFT-Orchestrator (MDFT-O), that is both general and flexible. We also show experimentally that MDFT-O both generates better decisions than using a heuristic that takes a weighted average of competing policies (WA-O), but also performs better in terms of mimicking human decisions as collected through Amazon Mechanical Turk (AMT). Our methodology is therefore able to faithfully model human decision in ethically constrained decision environments.",cognitive model; ethical constraints; human decision-making process; markov decision processes; orchestration,978-1-4503-9247-1,,2022,2023-11-06 01:29:53,2023-11-06 01:29:53,447–454,AIES '22,Association for Computing Machinery,LJNWK5ZI

A number of anomalous gender bias measurements in the embeddings of gendered languages suggest this possibility. We demonstrate that word embeddings learn the association between a noun and its grammatical gender in grammatically gendered languages, which can skew social gender bias measurements. Consequently, word embedding post-processing methods are introduced to quantify, disentangle, and evaluate grammatical gender signals. The evaluation is performed on five gendered languages from the Germanic, Romance, and Slavic branches of the Indo-European language family. Our method reduces the strength of grammatical gender signals, which is measured in terms of effect size (Cohen's d ), by a significant average of d = 1.3 for French, German, and Italian, and d = 0.56 for Polish and Spanish. Once grammatical gender is disentangled, the association between over 90% of 10,000 inanimate nouns and their assigned grammatical gender weakens, and cross-lingual bias results from the Word Embedding Association Test (WEAT) become more congruent with country-level implicit bias measurements. The results further suggest that disentangling grammatical gender signals from word embeddings may lead to improvement in semantic machine learning tasks.",bias; grammatical gender; word embeddings,978-1-4503-9247-1,,2022,2023-11-06 01:29:50,2023-11-06 01:29:50,518–531,AIES '22,Association for Computing Machinery,JWH2LUKL

Using data from the National Incident-Based Reporting System (NIBRS) and the National Survey on Drug Use and Health (NSDUH) programs, we investigate whether marijuana usage and purchasing behaviors can explain the racial composition of offenders in police records. We examine potential driving mechanisms behind these disparities and the extent to which county-level socioeconomic factors are associated with corresponding disparities. Our results indicate that the significant racial disparities in reported incidents and arrests cannot be explained by differences in marijuana days-of-use alone. Variations in the location where marijuana is purchased and in the frequency of these purchases partially explain the observed disparities. We observe an increase in racial disparities across most counties over the last decade, with the greatest increases in states that legalized the use of marijuana within this timeframe. Income, high school graduation rate, and rate of employment positively correlate with larger racial disparities, while the rate of incarceration is negatively correlated. We conclude with a discussion of the implications of the observed racial disparities in the context of algorithmic fairness.",law enforcement; marijuana; racial disparities,978-1-4503-9247-1,,2022,2023-11-06 01:29:50,2023-11-06 01:29:50,130–143,AIES '22,Association for Computing Machinery,VQHJWXQ7

Are such principles sufficient to promote the design of systems that support human flourishing? Even if a system is in some sense fair, just, or 'safe', it can nonetheless be exploitative, coercive, inconvenient, or otherwise conflict with cultural, individual, or social values. This paper proposes a dimension of interactional ethics thus far overlooked: the ways AI systems should treat human beings. For this purpose, we explore the philosophical concept of respect: if respect is something everyone needs and deserves, shouldn't technology aim to be respectful? Despite its intuitive simplicity, respect in philosophy is a complex concept with many disparate senses. Like fairness or justice, respect can characterise how people deserve to be treated; but rather than relating primarily to the distribution of benefits or punishments, respect relates to how people regard one another, and how this translates to perception, treatment, and behaviour. We explore respect broadly across several literatures, synthesising perspectives on respect from Kantian, post-Kantian, dramaturgical, and agential realist design perspectives with a goal of drawing together a view of what respect could mean for AI. In so doing, we identify ways that respect may guide us towards more sociable artefacts that ethically and inclusively honour and recognise humans using the rich social language that we have evolved to interact with one another every day.",AI systems; ethical design; respect,978-1-4503-9247-1,,2022,2023-11-06 01:29:50,2023-11-06 01:29:50,641–652,AIES '22,Association for Computing Machinery,FMMUL74V

Nevertheless, harmful outcomes biased against vulnerable groups have been reported. The growing research field known as 'algorithmic fairness' aims to mitigate these harmful biases. Its primary methodology consists in proposing mathematical metrics to address the social harms resulting from an algorithm's biased outputs. The metrics are typically motivated by – or substantively rooted in – ideals of distributive justice, as formulated by political and legal philosophers. The perspectives of feminist political philosophers on social justice, by contrast, have been largely neglected. Some feminist philosophers have criticized the local scope of the paradigm of distributive justice and have proposed corrective amendments to surmount its limitations. The present paper brings some key insights of feminist political philosophy to algorithmic fairness. The paper has three goals. First, I show that algorithmic fairness does not accommodate structural injustices in its current scope. Second, I defend the relevance of structural injustices – as pioneered in the contemporary philosophical literature by Iris Marion Young – to algorithmic fairness. Third, I take some steps in developing the paradigm of 'responsible algorithmic fairness' to correct for errors in the current scope and implementation of algorithmic fairness.

Among these are algorithmic personality tests that use insights from psychometric testing, and promise to surface personality traits indicative of future success based on job seekers' resumes or social media profiles. We interrogate the reliability of such systems using stability of the outputs they produce, noting that reliability is a necessary, but not a sufficient, condition for validity. We develop a methodology for an external audit of stability of algorithmic personality tests, and instantiate this methodology in an audit of two systems, Humantic AI and Crystal. Rather than challenging or affirming the assumptions made in psychometric testing – that personality traits are meaningful and measurable constructs, and that they are indicative of future success on the job – we frame our methodology around testing the underlying assumptions made by the vendors of the algorithmic personality tests themselves.In our audit of Humantic AI and Crystal, we find that both systems show substantial instability on key facets of measurement, and so cannot be considered valid testing instruments. For example, Crystal frequently computes different personality scores if the same resume is given in PDF vs. in raw text, violating the assumption that the output of an algorithmic personality test is stable across job-irrelevant input variations. Among other notable findings is evidence of persistent — and often incorrect — data linkage by Humantic AI.An open-source implementation of our auditing methodology, and of the audits of Humantic AI and Crystal, is available at https://github.com/DataResponsibly/hiring-stability-audit.",algorithm audit; hiring; personality; reliability; stability; validity,978-1-4503-9247-1,,2022,2023-11-06 01:29:53,2023-11-06 01:29:53,572–587,AIES '22,Association for Computing Machinery,SW55FRCD

Despite their efficacy in providing valuable insights, existing approaches fail to deliver consistent and reliable explanations. In this paper, we propose an active learning-based technique called UnRAvEL (Uncertainty driven Robust Active learning based locally faithful Explanations), which consists of a novel acquisition function that is locally faithful and uses uncertainty-driven sampling based on the posterior distribution on the probabilistic locality using Gaussian process regression (GPR). We present a theoretical analysis of UnRAvEL by treating it as a local optimizer and analyzing its regret in terms of instantaneous regrets over a global optimizer. We demonstrate the efficacy of the local samples generated by UnRAvEL by incorporating different kernels such as the Matern and linear kernels in GPR. Through a series of experiments, we show that UnRAvEL outperforms the baselines with respect to stability and local fidelity on several real-world models and datasets. We show that UnRAvEL is an efficient surrogate dataset generator by deriving importance scores on this surrogate dataset using sparse linear models.

The technical possibilities of user profiling methods go beyond the classification of individuals into types of potential customers. They enable the transformation of implicit identity claims of individuals into explicit declarations of identity. As such, a key ethical challenge of social media profiling is that it stands in contrast with people's ability to self-determine autonomously, a core principle of the right to informational self-determination.In this research study, we take a step back and revisit theories of personal identity in philosophy that underline two constitutive meta-principles necessary for individuals to self-interpret autonomously: justification and control. That is, individuals have the ability to justify and control essential aspects of their self-concept. Returning to a philosophical basis for the value of self-determination serves as a reminder that user profiling is essentially normative in that it formalizes a person's self-concept within an algorithmic system. To understand whether social media users would want to justify and control social media's identity declarations, we conducted a vignette survey study (N = 368). First, participants indicate a strong preference for more transparency in social media identity declarations, a core requirement for the justification of a self-concept. Second, respondents state they would correct wrong identity declarations but show no clear motivation to manage them. Finally, our results illustrate that social media users acknowledge the narrative force of social media profiling but do not strongly believe in its capacity to shape their self-concept.",autonomy; ethics of artificial intelligence; personal identity; social media; user profiling,978-1-4503-9247-1,,2022,2023-11-06 01:29:50,2023-11-06 01:29:50,238–252,AIES '22,Association for Computing Machinery,EEZTVL5N

While several fair algorithms are proposed to alleviate these discrimination issues, most of them provide fairness by imposing constraints to eliminate disparity in prediction results. However, the use of these fair algorithms may change the behavior of prediction subjects. As such, even though the disparity in prediction results might be removed by fair algorithms, behavioral responses to the use of fair algorithms can still create disparity in behavior which may persist across different groups of prediction subjects. To study this issue, we define a notion called ""strategic best-response fairness"" (SBR-fair). It is defined in a context that includes different groups of prediction subjects who are ex-ante identical in terms of abilities and conditional payoffs. We utilize a game-theoretic model to investigate whether different types of fair algorithms lead to identical equilibrium behaviors among different groups of prediction subjects. If yes, such an algorithm is considered SBR-fair. We then demonstrate that many existing fair algorithms are not SBR-fair.

Before proceeding to evaluate other professions, AI ethicists should critically evaluate their own; yet, such an evaluation should be more explicitly and systematically undertaken in the literature. I argue that these insufficiencies could be mitigated by developing a research agenda for a feminist metaethics of AI. Contrary to traditional metaethics, which reflects on the nature of morality and moral judgements in a non-normative way, feminist metaethics expands its scope to ask not only what ethics is but also what our engagement with it should be like. Applying this perspective to the context of AI, I suggest that a feminist metaethics of AI would examine: (i) the continuity between theory and action in AI ethics; (ii) the real-life effects of AI ethics; (iii) the role and profile of those involved in AI ethics; and (iv) the effects of AI on power relations through methods that pay attention to context, emotions and narrative.",AI ethics; artificial intelligence; ethics-washing; feminist philosophy; metaethics,978-1-4503-9247-1,,2022,2023-11-06 01:29:49,2023-11-06 01:29:49,665–674,AIES '22,Association for Computing Machinery,YY2382AC

When deployment environments are expected to undergo changes (that is, dataset shifts), it is important for OPE methods to perform robust evaluation of the policies amidst such changes. Existing approaches consider robustness against a large class of shifts that can arbitrarily change any observable property of the environment. This often results in highly pessimistic estimates of the utilities, thereby invalidating policies that might have been useful in deployment. In this work, we address the aforementioned problem by investigating how domain knowledge can help provide more realistic estimates of the utilities of policies. We leverage human inputs on which aspects of the environments may plausibly change, and adapt the OPE methods to only consider shifts on these aspects. Specifically, we propose a novel framework, Robust OPE (ROPE), which considers shifts on a subset of covariates in the data based on user inputs, and estimates worst-case utility under these shifts. We then develop computationally efficient algorithms for OPE that are robust to the aforementioned shifts for contextual bandits and Markov decision processes. We also theoretically analyze the sample complexity of these algorithms. Extensive experimentation with synthetic and real world datasets from the healthcare domain demonstrates that our approach not only captures realistic dataset shifts accurately, but also results in less pessimistic policy evaluations.",dataset shift; human-in-the-loop; policy evaluation; robust learning; adversarial machine learning,978-1-4503-9247-1,,2022,2023-11-06 01:29:56,2023-11-06 01:29:56,686–699,AIES '22,Association for Computing Machinery,U3NTY2DZ

In this paper, we extend prior work in this direction by taking a perspective of repeated interactions—We ask that when decision subjects interact with an AI-based decision system repeatedly and can strategically respond to the system by determining whether to stay in the system, what factors will affect the decision subjects' fairness perceptions and retention in the system and how. To answer these questions, we conducted two randomized human-subject experiments in the context of an AI-based loan lending system. Our results suggest that in repeated interactions with the AI-based decision system, overall, decision subjects' fairness perceptions and retention in the system are significantly affected by whether the system is in favor of the group that subjects themselves belong to, rather than whether the system treats different groups in an unbiased way. However, decision subjects with different qualification levels have different reactions to the AI system's biased treatment across groups or the AI system's tendency to favor/disfavor their own group. Finally, we also find that while subjects' retention in the AI-based decision system is largely driven by their own prospects of receiving the favorable decision from the system, their fairness perceptions of the system is influenced by the system's treatment to people in other groups in a complex way.",fairness; human-AI interaction; fairness perceptions; AI-based decision systems; human-subject experiments; retention,978-1-4503-9247-1,,2022,2023-11-06 01:29:53,2023-11-06 01:29:53,295–306,AIES '22,Association for Computing Machinery,RNUQX4F4

Black Lives Matter (BLM) and Stop Asian Hate (SAH) are two successful social movements that have spread on Twitter that promote protests and activities against racism and increase the public's awareness of other social challenges that minority groups face. However, previous studies have mostly conducted qualitative analyses of tweets or interviews with users, which may not comprehensively and validly represent all tweets. Very few studies have explored the Twitter topics within BLM and SAH dialogs in a rigorous, quantified and data-centered approach. Therefore, in this research, we adopted a mixed-methods approach to comprehensively analyze BLM and SAH Twitter topics. We implemented (1) the latent Dirichlet allocation model to understand the top high-level words and topics and (2) open-coding analysis to identify specific themes across the tweets. We collected more than one million tweets with the #blacklivesmatter and #stopasianhate hashtags and compared their topics. Our findings revealed that the tweets discussed a variety of influential topics in depth, and social justice, social movements, and emotional sentiments were common topics in both movements, though with unique subtopics for each movement. Our study contributes to the topic analysis of social movements on social media platforms in particular and the literature on the interplay of AI, ethics, and society in general.",#blacklivesmatter; #stopasianhate; ai; dirichlet allocation model; ethics; natural language processing; open-coding analysis; social movements; society; topic analysis; twitter,978-1-4503-9247-1,,2022,2023-11-06 01:29:50,2023-11-06 01:29:50,723–738,AIES '22,Association for Computing Machinery,UG76ZIEP

Second, we determine that human experts are not able to accurately predict patient race from the same redacted clinical notes.

How to Design Smart Homes for Older Persons: The Somatic Capability Assessment as an Answer to Current Design Challenges,"Proceedings of the 2022 AAAI/ACM Conference on AI, Ethics, and Society",,,10.1145/3514094.3539514,"Felber, Nadine Andrea",2022,https://doi.org/10.1145/3514094.3539514,conferencePaper,"Older persons have had decades to get to know their environment - and usually their home - through their own somatic experience. This somatic or ""felt"" experience enables them to assess their own capabilities when it comes to executing activities of daily living [1]. This is what we call ""somatic capability assessment"" or SCA in short, inspired by the theory of somaaesthetics [2]. The home offers the ideal background for an older person's - or any person's - SCA, as it feels familiar, stable, and private [3,4,5]. Smart home technology (SHT) while having the potential to support older persons to age in place [6], is nevertheless bound to disrupt these qualities of the former, non-smart home, and therefore also alter the SCA of an older person. This is because the monitoring sensors in the smart home add an external stream of data is now to the somatic, embodied experience of the person. When the assessment of the smart home disagrees with the SCA of the older resident, this can create serious challenges in daily living. However, putting the SCA at the center of designing monitoring capacities in a smart home for older persons may also be the solution of these challenges.In this paper, we first present how we developed the concept of SCA, then show why the home with its characteristics of familiarity, stability and privacy is important for the SCA. In a next step, we explain how the smart home potentially alters these perceived features of the former non-smart home, creating disruptive experiences for the resident, which may end in the older person rejecting the smart home altogether, thus undermining the whole justification of existence of the smart home for older persons. To counteract this possibility, we propose somatic design measures as well as a framework for the designing process, to adequately support and possibly enhance the SCA of older persons living in smart homes.This paper is part of a larger PhD-thesis which investigates the social and ethical boundaries of the use of smart home technologies for older persons, their professional caregivers, and their family members.",ethics; design; aging in place; home; monitoring; older persons; smart home; somatic,978-1-4503-9247-1,,2022,2023-11-06 01:29:55,2023-11-06 01:29:55,900,AIES '22,Association for Computing Machinery,Z4FT47PS
The Danger of Citizen Domination through Algorithmic Decision-Making in the Public Sector,"Proceedings of the 2022 AAAI/ACM Conference on AI, Ethics, and Society",,,10.1145/3514094.3539515,"Misic, Jana",2022,https://doi.org/10.1145/3514094.3539515,conferencePaper,"Applying for and gaining welfare benefits from the government is a different practice than a decade ago. Digital technologies, including emerging ones such as artificial intelligence and big data are increasingly popular in the public services sector. One such instance is a pilot project employing citizen profiling through artificial intelligence to implement a more efficient welfare policy in The Hague. The 'Bijstand' (prim. trans. 'Assistance') project relies on the use of machine learning to detect unemployed citizens that could be most efficiently helped by the municipality in finding employment. Intuitively, deployment of such projects has a potentially negative impact on how just and fair procedures of access to employment are and is therefore a cause for concern in respect to citizens' wellbeing.In this paper I aim to validate or challenge the intuition that the citizens who are subjected to public sector decision-making algorithms are in fact dominated upon. Is it feasible or fair to call the algorithmic toll a dominator or should we focus attention on the human agents? I draw on the neo-republican concept of freedom as non-domination and argue for the importance of investigating potential for domination as a structurally constituted form of power when algorithmization of public services takes place. Going beyond, I combine the insights from the neo-republican theory of domination with applied ethics of technology, drawing on the relationships between virtues of freedom and wellbeing vis-a-vis algorithmic accountability. The case study reveals that a new procedural element of unaccountable decision-making is being introduced into the welfare services. A hopeful takeaway from using the neo-republican lens shows that the state can be a guarantor of freedom by establishing the right procedures and venues for the citizens to challenge algorithmic decision-making.",algorithms; automated decision-making; non-domination; public sector,978-1-4503-9247-1,,2022,2023-11-06 01:29:50,2023-11-06 01:29:50,905,AIES '22,Association for Computing Machinery,JQGCGD2K

Artificial intelligence (AI) describes systems that mimic human cognitive functions and that are designed to achieve specific goals, execute tasks, make decisions or achieve goals in complex situations autonomously.AI can greatly facilitate people's daily and business lives, but it also brings challenges, such as privacy, transparency, discrimination, job loss, and responsibility. One of the main challenges related to the adoption and implementation of AI is the current connotations and perceptions of the subject. To some people, AI is a mysterious concept, and it is difficult to understand how it manifests in their daily lives. The development and application of AI raise several ethical issues, including the interaction of AI with human rights such as privacy and discrimination [2]. Previous studies [1, 3-5] have examined some aspects of AI. In this study, I have employed a new scale to measure the general attitudes of the public towards AI.I have conducted an empirical study of public attitudes towards various aspects of the use of AI. The participants were the public in Serbia (N=737) who filled out an online questionnaire. The questionnaire consisted of general socio-demographic questions, questions about familiarity with AI, a brief introduction to the concept of AI, and questions about participants' attitudes towards the use of AI. Participants were asked to what degree they (dis)agree with the statements on the 5-point Likert scale. I have investigated whether age, education, previous knowledge of AI, profession, and level of religiosity influences people's attitudes towards AI. Objectives were to (1) examine the public's attitudes in Serbia toward the use of AI; (2) determine which factors influence these attitudes; (3) examine whether the public shares the concerns identified by ethical philosophers in the debates on AI; (4) examine prior knowledge of the public on AI. Data were analyzed in the R programming language. The general attitude towards the use of AI was assessed by creating a composite score based on the questions in which the respondents expressed their attitudes towards different aspects of the use of AI.The results showed that the public in Serbia has a divided opinion on the use of AI. Half of them have positive, and the other half negative attitudes. These attitudes are influenced by variables such as the respondents' age, education, profession, level of religiosity, and prior knowledge of AI, in a way that young, highly educated, non-religious, those with highly qualified jobs, especially IT professionals, and those who are more familiar with the concept of AI, have more positive attitudes towards the use of AI. Also, the results showed that the public is concerned about the disappearance of professions due to the development of AI and discrimination by AI systems. The results suggest a need to educate the public about challenges and ways to prevent them. It is necessary to increase transparency in decision-making processes related to the implementation of AI and dialogue between the public on the one hand and the state and the private sector on the other. I argue that considering different aspects of public attitudes toward AI enhances this debate. The results are valuable for future work on this topic because similar public opinion polls have not been conducted, especially not in Serbia. Public opinion has not shaped conversations about the use of AI. Another focus should be on further research of the attitudes of the public and experts on specific applications of AI and related ethical challenges. This research has implications for future research, particularly when forming an AI attitude scale.",AI; ethical concerns; knowledge; public attitudes,978-1-4503-9247-1,,2022,2023-11-06 01:29:54,2023-11-06 01:29:54,892,AIES '22,Association for Computing Machinery,4E48YYP8

Contradictory to what was preached in the 20th century, we now accept emotions as important part of ourselves that contributes to our reasoning and decision-making process. Furthermore, we recognized them as necessary components in the construction of relationships. This shift in the paradigm towards emotions has increased their value in the public eye. In a paradoxical way, we now tend to communicate more than ever this subjective experience and thus, as we communicate it, we insist on its personal and private status. Our emotions are ours and ours alone. But is it true? By being both recognized as a part of the inner life that is never completely reachable and as a necessary component of relationships, emotions appear to be at the edge of every concept of privacy.This research project will work on this specific blind spot in the literature through the analysis of emotion recognition software (ERS) as a threat to both the privacy of the inner life and the privacy of relationships. The main claims are that emotions must be both recognized as (1) being more than a part of the inner self, e.g., for instance, as actively contributing to communication and the construction of relationships, and (2) considered off-limits from scrutinization and monitoring by governments and corporate in contexts in which the use of ERS disrupt and restrict the possibility to freely experience them as inner affective states and/or to freely use them as a communication tool. The hypothesis is as follows. The first premise assume that the phenomenon of emotion is commonly accepted as being a fundamental component of human experience. From that first assumption is derive the second one; that it is, therefore, a necessary element to live a meaningful life.From that standpoint, I draw upon Helen Nissenbaum's framework of contextual integrity [1] and hypothesize that the context in which the individual shares his or her emotions daily should be recognized as a non-violable whole (set of natural, social, cultural conditions) whose integrity allows for the exercise of this fundamental component of human experience, which is a necessity for living a meaningful life. While emotions are seen as ""in the public space"" because we constantly use them to communicate, I want to argue that emotions ""in the public space"" should be considered a priori off-limit from monitoring and scrutinization by State and corporate until proven otherwise by the contextual integrity framework.The general stance is that a constant monitoring and scrutinization by ERS will have a disruptive effect on the way we experience and express emotions, which will have a direct impact on our way of building and maintaining relationships, putting at higher risk the possibility of achieving a meaningful life. Therefore, I want to draw what could be seen as a draconian line between what citizens on one side and what States and corporate on the other should be allowed to do and not do. Emotions should not be considered something that individuals should refrain from experiencing, communicating, and accessing, however, they should be considered highly sensitive and intimate information and, thus, States and corporate should refrain from monitoring and scrutinizing them. Furthermore, I argue that a massive deployment of ERS by government and private companies will transform the cultural and societal practices as well as affecting our fundamental rights and values.",privacy; emotion recognition software; emotions; public and private space; relationships,978-1-4503-9247-1,,2022,2023-11-06 01:29:52,2023-11-06 01:29:52,909,AIES '22,Association for Computing Machinery,MQSYAFQW

Hijacking Epistemic Agency: How Emerging Technologies Threaten Our Wellbeing as Knowers,"Proceedings of the 2022 AAAI/ACM Conference on AI, Ethics, and Society",,,10.1145/3514094.3539537,"Dorsch, John",2022,https://doi.org/10.1145/3514094.3539537,conferencePaper,"The aim of this project to expose the reasons behind the pandemic of misinformation (henceforth, PofM) by examining the enabling conditions of epistemic agency and the emerging technologies that threaten it. I plan to research the emotional origin of epistemic agency, i.e. on the origin of our capacity to acquire justification for belief, as well as on the significance this emotional origin has for our lives as epistemic agents in our so-called Misinformation Age [1]. This project has three objectives. First, I plan to expose the degree to which epistemic agency is made possible by an under-researched species of emotion called epistemic feelings [2] [3]. Perhaps, the most epistemically significant is the feeling of confidence [4]. In particular, epistemic feelings make epistemic agency possible by making errors in reasoning salient or the potential lack thereof [5].Second, in order to diagnose the reasons for PofM, I will analyze the emotional basis of epistemic agency in the context of emerging technologies [6]. Epistemic feelings ought to be construed as motivators of epistemic acts, specifically acts following exposure to misinformation spread by social media [7]. For example, a recent study found that subjects on YouTube have a 6.3% probability in five clicks to go from watching innocuous videos to misogynistic videos [8]. Accordingly, one prominent view holds that social media algorithms lead subjects down the proverbial rabbit hole, producing content that elicits strong emotional reactions [9] [10].But under-researched is the degree to which these emotions are intertwined with epistemic feelings, so that subjects are likely to misjudge the information as correct due to being primed to do so by processing the AI's suggested media. Thus, when this technology is used in epistemic practices, the result is invariably epistemically bad behavior because of how this manner of producing content motivates epistemic acts through the production of erroneous feelings of confidence, which result from the perceived ease of cognitive processing [11] [12]: the content is easy to process and so, the subject confidently misjudges, it is true. As of yet, an account of this cognitive and emotional decision-making process has not been used to analyze how emerging technologies are threatening epistemic agency, and thus our wellbeing as knowers.Finally, I plan to develop therapeutics for PofM by outlining how to reform our collective epistemic practices. Thus, this project complements existing research in virtue epistemology [13], specifically by articulating the challenges to cultivating epistemic virtues and warding off the vices of the mind [14]. In summation, the project aims to account for how emerging technologies are committing a form of epistemic injustice [15] through the exploitation of cognitive biases and the production of erroneous epistemic feelings, with the overarching goal being a framework for convalescing from the pandemic of misinformation plaguing our age.",ai ethics; metacognition; philosophy of technology; virtue epistemology,978-1-4503-9247-1,,2022,2023-11-06 01:29:49,2023-11-06 01:29:49,897,AIES '22,Association for Computing Machinery,7F85PKES

Exploitation and Algorithmic Pricing: Regressive Distributive Outcomes in Consumer-to-Business Transactions,"Proceedings of the 2022 AAAI/ACM Conference on AI, Ethics, and Society",,,10.1145/3514094.3539542,"Dini, Arianna",2022,https://doi.org/10.1145/3514094.3539542,conferencePaper,"I present a theory of exploitation that can be used to appraise algorithmic pricing and identify when it might contribute to injustice. I develop a structural, consequentialist theory, which shows that exploitation is parasitic on existing inequalities. Exploitation is a sub-theme within the broader concerns of distributive egalitarians. I use ""inequality"" to signify unjust distributive inequity resulting from morally arbitrary, rather than justified, differences. This distinction is murky: skills are often as much a product of privilege as they are of work ethic. Nevertheless, some causes of distributive inequality (class, ethnicity, or gender) are more obviously morally arbitrary than others (skill or work ethic). There are many reasons for supporting distributive equality: I favour the Humean idea that equality is necessary for reciprocity, and that reciprocity is the foundation of a just social equilibrium [1][2]. However, a defence of this theory is beyond the scope of this paper; I therefore take it as a given that a reasonable degree of distributive equality is desirable in contemporary nation states, without specifying how much is ""reasonable"".The information asymmetry between sellers and consumers is the most obvious inequality in transactions mediated by algorithmic pricing. However, even without information asymmetry, dynamic pricing algorithms are designed to detect any imbalance between supply and demand, and to exploit this as much as possible to maximise profits. Since demand is a reflection of scarcity and urgency, dynamic pricing pushes prices up as far as the consumer's bargaining position will allow-without losing the consumer. I therefore address information asymmetry separately (forthcoming); here I show that the sufficient conditions for exploitation to emerge are minimal, and do not require the intent to manipulate consumers.I respond to potential criticisms of my theory. I explain why the Paretian defence-that mutually beneficial transactions are permissible, irrespective of the difference in benefit [3]-only holds up in case there is a dichotomy (deal/no deal), but that the value of a theory of exploitation is precisely that it highlights the contingency of such dichotomies.This allows me answer the concerns of critics who worry that a consequentialist conception of exploitation guts the concept of its inherent wrongness [4]. In some cases, an exploitative contract may be pragmatically better than no contract, but an injustice-albeit a ""lesser evil""-is occurring. Calling it ""exploitation"" remains a useful way of drawing attention to the structural circumstances which gave rise to unfair option sets.I explain how my theory applies to algorithmic pricing in consumer-to-platform transactions, by presenting a 2020 study, which found that ride-hailing apps in Chicago were charging passengers from low-income neighbourhoods and ethnic minority backgrounds more for lifts than white passengers from more affluent neighbourhoods [5]. Reserve price is not only a marker of disposable income, but rather, of a whole set of factors that influence willingness-to-pay. Scarcity drives demand up. In low-income neighbourhoods, fewer residents are likely to demand ride-hailing services. Due to low demand, drivers are less likely to enter these areas, as doing so will decrease the chance of finding another passenger quickly. Low-income neighbourhoods thereby become under-serviced, and residents who do hail rides are effectively penalised by having to pay a surcharge. In cases that attracted widespread condemnation, price surges occurred in the wake of mass shootings, terrorist attacks, or natural disasters [6]. Such cases may be wrong for other reasons, but do not fall into the category of exploitation as I define it, since the consumers' bargaining power is diminished due to highly rare and improbable circumstances rather than structural inequality. Thus, dynamic pricing can produce regressive outcomes. This should concern anyone interested in distributive equality, and might justify interventions to mitigate the effects on vulnerable groups.",algorithmic pricing; big data; distributive justice; dynamic pricing; exploitation; pricing algorithms; structural exploitation,978-1-4503-9247-1,,2022,2023-11-06 01:29:54,2023-11-06 01:29:54,896,AIES '22,Association for Computing Machinery,23EFCGWP

The law has been slow to catch up, but some solutions have been presented in global governance initiatives. However, these solutions are not without their challenges. Thus, a potential solution examined in this research is that of legal personhood for AI systems. The central question being whether there are compelling moral and legal reasons to grant some AI systems a degree of legal personhood.Within the global regulatory landscape, this position is heavily critiqued and labelled as ethically undesirable. However, this research contends that: (1) there may be moral reasons to grant specific AI with a sui generis form of legal personhood; and (2) there are strong legal rationales to endow some AI with a form of legal personhood.In terms of argument (1), this research finds that: (a) the debate in this area is largely unrepresentative of African philosophical thought. African philosophical thought tends to prize relationality (Metz, Eze, and Menketi) at its core; and (b) within this communitarian framework, this research finds that African philosophical thought may allow for some AI systems to be both subjects and objects of relationships.In terms of argument (2), this research contends that there are other important legal values for endowing some AI systems with legal personhood - such as legal efficiency, market efficiency, legal certainty, and accountability. The examples referred to which support this contention are: (i) AI inventiveness and creativity in intellectual property (IP) law; and (ii) liability in the instance where AI is an actor in healthcare. Furthermore, the strict liability route, as suggested by the European Union (EU), is problematic [5], especially for lower- middle-income countries (LMICs), such as South Africa. LMICs have smaller economies and often struggle with healthcare services, thus it is imperative that there exists an enabling environment for innovation. For this, LMICs regulatory regimes need to be more 'friendly' to developers and deployers of AI. As such, there is an imperative for out-of-the box legal solutions to these novel problems.",artificial intelligence; ethics; law; governance; legal personhood,978-1-4503-9247-1,,2022,2023-11-06 01:29:58,2023-11-06 01:29:58,906,AIES '22,Association for Computing Machinery,JK6LR65K

Although such models have been developed to try to reduce human bias and thus bring greater fairness to financial services decisions, studies have found that there is still significant discrimination by both face-to-face and algorithmic lenders. In fact, Apple has recently been investigated for gender discrimination in assigning a credit limit to its users, demonstrating that there may still be inherent biases in the development of such algorithms and models. Furthermore, biases in financial services models may not only lead to unfair discrimination but were also linked to health problems and recovery prospects.This project aims to analyse and identify the different types of biases found in AI models and data used in the financial services industry. We propose a method using data analysis and explainable models to explain how these biases emerge throughout the process of developing AI models as well as applying state-of-the-art bias dealing techniques to avoid and mitigate them. Finally, we propose how to evaluate these models according to the business objectives and consider possible trade-offs between different definitions of fairness. Thus, the main questions that this project will try to answer are as follows: - What are the current biases in credit risk and fraud detection models and how to identify them? - In what ways understanding how biases emerge from the data can help us in bias mitigation? - To what extent could credit risk and fraud detection models bias be mitigated, and what are the implications of those mitigation techniques?Answering these questions, we hope to create a pipeline for building these models by understanding the key points where bias can emerge and the appropriate methods to avoid it.",fairness; bias; machine learning; financial services,978-1-4503-9247-1,,2022,2023-11-06 01:29:58,2023-11-06 01:29:58,908,AIES '22,Association for Computing Machinery,6GAYZWMS

Social scientists can then help engineers better understand the population they are gathering data from. To be successful, however, interdisciplinary collaborations require more than just gathering researchers from various fields around a table. They call for addressing challenges such as developing a common language, understanding different ways of reasoning, and addressing epistemic controversies to agree on shared criteria upon which can be assessed the validity of the co-produced knowledge. Controversies bring about relevant epistemic questions to promote an ongoing reflection on scientific methods. In contrast, when a discipline leverages its own methods to approach a topic traditionally associated with another discipline, the unsolicited interference is often followed by a backlash which undermines the possibility of collaboration (e.g., [1], [2], [3]).New environments emerge in academic centers willing to welcome interdisciplinary research and a key challenge is creating practices and methodologies that could enable such research. Computational philosophy is the approach I develop to serve this goal. I present here two examples of such collaborations I have led, as a philosopher, alongside machine learning engineers. These collaborations resulted in great outcomes and significantly advanced the state of the art in the domain of online social interactions.The first example is an empirical study on misinformation based on an analysis of user-generated reports from Facebook and Instagram [4]. The mixed approach I developed with Onur Çelebi allowed us to identify meaningful variations in the volumes and types of false news, as well as in the manipulative strategies developed to spread misinformation among countries and platforms. Thanks to an original typology we created to classify content, we were able to identify four distinct types of behaviors for users reporting content to moderators. This allowed us to propose explanations for up to 55% of the inaccuracy in user reports, suggest solutions to improve the overall signal by taking action on the different sources of inaccuracy, and build a classifier capable of distinguishing credible user reports from others to support misinformation detection.The second example is an empirical study of social influencers on Instagram [5]. François Charton and I developed an original typology to classify Instagram influencers based on their source of legitimacy. This allowed us to identify different kinds of audiences characteristic of the different types of influencers, which we analyzed through René Girard's mimetic desire theory [6]. This research enriched Girard's philosophical theory while it helped us advance the understanding of social interactions between influencers and their followers by superimposing a communication system inspired by Marshall McLuhan's media theory onto them [7]. Leveraging different signals, we were then able to identify for each category of influencer which kinds of posts were most likely to generate a positive response and negative feedback.I am now expanding my approach to hate speech, bringing together the psychological mechanisms of hate conceptualized by Girard [8] to better understand the manifestations of hate on Instagram. These three blocks should then allow me to present a holistic approach to online interactions upon which an ethical system for the moderation of problematic online interactions could be erected.",AI ethics; behavioral sciences; content moderation; misinformation; philosophy of AI,978-1-4503-9247-1,,2022,2023-11-06 01:29:49,2023-11-06 01:29:49,899,AIES '22,Association for Computing Machinery,S6HCNDH8
The Opacity of Automated Decision-Making Systems (ADMS) and Its Challenges for Political Legitimacy in a Democracy,"Proceedings of the 2022 AAAI/ACM Conference on AI, Ethics, and Society",,,10.1145/3514094.3539563,"Jiménez, María Carolina",2022,https://doi.org/10.1145/3514094.3539563,conferencePaper,"This paper focuses specifically on Automated Decision-Making Systems (ADMS) based on Artificial Intelligence (AI). Since the last decades, AI systems are increasingly deployed by governments across the planet to manage public infrastructures and resources, as well as to engage with citizens for the provision of public services. Their introduction is advertised as a cost-cutting tool, as well as an instrument to combat traditional institutional disfunctions such as inefficiency, understaffing, corruption and human bias.While AI offers an incredible potential for progress, an emerging body of literature highlights the challenges that AI-driven decision-making may raise for a public sector ethics. A common trait of these challenges is their being related to some form of ""epistemological opacity"" that undermines the capacity of humans to explain and justify decisions based on AI systems, detect errors or unfairness and adopt corrective actions. The situation may entail public officers and citizens taking the outcomes of AI systems at face value, thus basing their actions (wholly or in part) on pieces of information that cannot be scrutinized and/or corrected if necessary.This paper intends to contribute to an emerging but still underdeveloped trend in normative political theory that study how AI-driven decision-making is reshaping the conceptualization and assessment of interactions between citizens and public officials. The overall goal of the paper is to analyze how various sources of ""epistemological opacity"" (algorithmic/legal/illiteracy/discursive) affecting AI systems, may undermine the democratic legitimacy of public decisions based on them.Broadly speaking, legitimacy is the property that grounds the exercise of political authority, where authority standardly means the right to rule [1]. In this paper, democratic legitimacy is understood as a distinctive form of political authority grounded in the recognition of citizens as joint legislators. The paper offers a conception of democratic legitimacy conditional on the capacity of decision-making procedures and outcomes to realize the principle of public equality, which requires citizens' control over public decision-making, as well as respect for their equal status as political decision-makers.Specifically, the paper argues that the ""epistemological opacity"" affecting AI-driven decision-making systems, brings about a mistreatment of citizens as coauthors of public decisions, which is a premise of the idea of democratic citizenship.The main conjecture is that different sources of ""epistemological opacity"" (algorithmic/legal/illiteracy/discursive) are causing the disengagement of citizens and public officers from public decision-making, either because they directly undermine necessary conditions for the realization of public equality (co-authorship/accountability/publicity), or because they hide from the public eye instances of illegitimate automation and privatization of decisional power.The paper offers a normative conception of democratic legitimacy that may contribute to efforts in various fields, including ""AI fairness"" and ""Explainable AI"", to better adapt technological tools to equality requirements distinctive of public decision-making within democratic societies.",AI ethics; algorithmic opacity; automation; democratic legitimacy; machine learning; public sector,978-1-4503-9247-1,,2022,2023-11-06 01:29:49,2023-11-06 01:29:49,901,AIES '22,Association for Computing Machinery,EBCUNNYT

Yet, machine learning tools that sort, categorize, and predict the social sphere have become common place, developed and deployed in various domains from education, law enforcement, to medicine and border control. In this talk, I emphasize that machine learning models of social systems are at best a snapshot of a moving target, and at worst systems that encode the status quo and exacerbate racism, sexism, and historical injustice. I first review some of the robust body of work that has emerged in this space. I, then, argue that equitable algorithmic systems require we look beyond technical solutions and call for acknowledgement and in depth understanding of complexity, historical injustice, and current societal power asymmetries. As well as challenging simple fairness metrics when algorithmic systems fail, broader structural rethinking, deeper understanding and envisioning an alternative future – one that is based on current realities of machine learning systems and their impacts – are critical.",ethics; fairness; justice; complex systems; large scale dataset; models,978-1-4503-9247-1,,2022,2023-11-06 01:29:52,2023-11-06 01:29:52,2,AIES '22,Association for Computing Machinery,FBRBCMNN

The question has invited well-placed concern from policymakers, as the prospect of millions of low-skilled workers finding themselves suddenly without employment brings with it the potential for tremendous social and economic disruption. Long-haul truck driving is perceived as a prime target for such displacement, due to the fast-developing technical capabilities of autonomous vehicles (many of which lend themselves to the specific needs of truck driving), characteristics of trucking labor, and the political economy of the industry. In most of the public rhetoric about the threat of the self-driving truck, the trucker is seen as a displaced party. He is displaced both physically and economically: removed from the cab of the truck, and from his means of economic provision. The robot has replaced his imperfect, disobedient, tired, and inefficient body, rendering him redundant, irrelevant, and jobless. But the reality is more complicated. The intrusion of automation into the truck cab certainly presents a threat to the trucker, but the threat is not solely or even primarily experienced, as it is so often described, as displacement. The trucker is still in the cab, doing the work of truck driving-but he is joined there by intelligent systems that monitor his body directly. Hats that monitor his brain waves and head position, vests that track his heart rate, cameras trained on his eyelids for signs of fatigue or inattention: these systems flash lights in his face, jolt his seat, and send reports to his dispatcher or even his family members should the trucker's focus waver. As more trucking firms integrate such technologies into their safety programs, truckers are not being displaced by intelligent systems so much as they are experiencing the emergence of intelligent systems as a compelled hybridization, a very intimate incursion into their work and bodies. This talk considers the dual, conflicting narratives of job replacement by robots and of bodily integration with robots, to assess the true range of AI's potential effects on low-wage work.",artificial intelligence; labor; work; truck driving,978-1-4503-9247-1,,2022,2023-11-06 01:29:57,2023-11-06 01:29:57,3,AIES '22,Association for Computing Machinery,JZGH3UDN

Relying on a recent investigation of the multi-dimensionality of human trust, I lay out five criteria of trustworthiness-being competent, reliable, transparent, benevolent, and having ethical integrity. I will argue that an essential ingredient of such trustworthiness is norm competence-the ability to represent, comply with, and learn relevant social-moral norms (including fairness as one among many).

Whereas a number of major urban-centered businesses have adopted remote working, rural areas and small towns with their small and medium-sized businesses show the insignificant development of remote working. Due to this, it is essential to characterize the regional ecosystem of digital inclusion, digital divide between the center and the periphery. Another complex problem that involves different stakeholders – citizens, state, corporations, public institutions etc. – is to define the boundaries of digital ethics. This problem requires a complex solution. The need of regulation to ensure compliance with ethical principles is increasing along with the accumulation of sufficient data that can be used in a way when the consequences can be as positive and as negative. The purpose of the research is to study the problem of human capital development and to elaborate on its structure and content via digital inclusion of the population. The tasks of the research are to systematize theoretical approaches to studying digital inclusion of population; to specify the content and factors of digital inequality; to explain the authors’ structure of human capital in the framework of digital inclusion. In order to analyze the issues of the stated problems, the authors used such methodological techniques and instruments as sociological, economic, systematic and spatial approaches, methods of structural and systems analysis, retrospective assessment and text mining. The main results of the research are the updated content and systematization of factors of digital inequality; detected social and economic grounds for digital inclusion as the instrument of human capital development in a particular territory; the authors’ level structure of human capital in the framework of digital inclusion; specification of the role and trends of modernizing the system of higher education in context of reducing the digital divide and increasing the efficiency of forming and using the human capital. The scientific importance of the research aims to expand the theoretical framework of approaches to the development of human capital via digital inclusion.

At present, computer vision artificial intelligence (AI) captures and interprets human faces for a variety of digital applications and services. The ambiguity of facial information has recently led to a debate among scholars in different fields about the types of inferences AI should make about people based on their facial looks. AI research often justifies facial AI inference-making by referring to how people form impressions in first-encounter scenarios. Critics raise concerns about bias and discrimination and warn that facial analysis AI resembles an automated version of physiognomy. What has been missing from this debate, however, is an understanding of how “non-experts” in AI ethically evaluate facial AI inference-making. In a two-scenario vignette study with 24 treatment groups, we show that non-experts (N = 3745) reject facial AI inferences such as trustworthiness and likability from portrait images in a low-stake advertising and a high-stake hiring context. In contrast, non-experts agree with facial AI inferences such as skin color or gender in the advertising but not the hiring decision context. For each AI inference, we ask non-experts to justify their evaluation in a written response. Analyzing 29,760 written justifications, we find that non-experts are either “evidentialists” or “pragmatists”: they assess the ethical status of a facial AI inference based on whether they think faces warrant sufficient or insufficient evidence for an inference (evidentialist justification) or whether making the inference results in beneficial or detrimental outcomes (pragmatist justification). Non-experts’ justifications underscore the normative complexity behind facial AI inference-making. AI inferences with insufficient evidence can be rationalized by considerations of relevance while irrelevant inferences can be justified by reference to sufficient evidence. We argue that participatory approaches contribute valuable insights for the development of ethical AI in an increasingly visual data culture.",artificial intelligence; computer vision; human faces; participatory AI ethics,978-1-4503-9352-2,,2022,2023-11-06 01:30:02,2023-11-06 01:30:02,128–141,FAccT '22,Association for Computing Machinery,S3ZRYKFD

However, in recent AI ethics and governance scholarship, AI ethics design appears to be divorced from AI ethics implementation, an implicit partition that results in two separate matters of theory and practice, respectively, and thus invokes efforts to bridge the‘gap’ between the two. Such a partition potentially overcomplicates the discussion surrounding AI ethics and limits its productivity. This paper thus presents South Korea’s people-centered‘National Guidelines for Artificial Intelligence Ethics’(국가인공지능윤리기준;‘Guidelines’) and their development under the Moon administration as a case study that can help readers conceptualize AI ethics design and implementation as a continuous process rather than a partitioned one. From a public value perspective, the case study examines the Guidelines and the multistakeholder policymaking infrastructure that serves as the foundation for both the Guidelines’ design and implementation. This examination draws from literature in AI ethics and governance, public management and administration, and Korean policy and cultural studies as well as government and public documents alongside 9 interviews with members from the four stakeholder groups that collectively designed and continue to deliberate upon the Guidelines. Further, the study specifically focuses on (i) identifying public values that were highlighted by the Guidelines, (ii) investigating how such values reflect prevalent Korean sociocultural norms, and (iii) exploring how these values, in a way made possible by Korean sociocultural norms and policymaking, have been negotiated amongst the four stakeholder groups in a democratic public sphere to be ultimately incorporated into the Guidelines and prepared for implementation.

Our investigation consists of an initial conceptual study with experts in ML, NLP, and AI Ethics, followed by a separate evaluative study with non-expert analysts who use ML models in their work. Using a semi-structured interview format coupled with a think-aloud protocol, we collected feedback from a total of 30 participants who engaged with different versions of standard and interactive model cards.

We describe how intersectional feminist goals and participatory processes shaped each stage of our approach, from problem conceptualization to data collection to model evaluation. We highlight several methodological contributions, including 1) an iterative data collection and annotation process that targets model weaknesses and interrogates framing concepts (such as who is included/excluded in “feminicide”), 2) models that explicitly focus on intersectional identities rather than statistical majorities, and 3) a multi-step evaluation process&nbsp;—&nbsp;with quantitative, qualitative and participatory steps&nbsp;—&nbsp;focused on context-specific relevance. We also distill insights and tensions that arise from bridging intersectional feminist goals with ML.

Making the Unaccountable Internet: The Changing Meaning of Accounting in the Early ARPANET,"Proceedings of the 2022 ACM Conference on Fairness, Accountability, and Transparency",,,10.1145/3531146.3533137,"Cooper, A. Feder; Vidan, Gili",2022,https://doi.org/10.1145/3531146.3533137,conferencePaper,"Contemporary concerns over the governance of technological systems often run up against narratives about the technical infeasibility of designing mechanisms for accountability. While in recent AI ethics literature these concerns have been deliberated predominantly in relation to machine learning, other instances in the history of computing also presented circumstances in which computer scientists needed to un-muddle what it means to design accountable systems. One such compelling narrative can frequently be found in canonical histories of the Internet that highlight how its original designers’ commitment to the “End-to-End” architectural principle precluded other features from being implemented, resulting in the fast-growing, generative, but ultimately unaccountable network we have today. This paper offers a critique of such technologically essentialist notions of accountability and the characterization of the “unaccountable Internet” as an unintended consequence. It explores the changing meaning of accounting and its relationship to accountability in a selected corpus of requests for comments (RFCs) concerning the early Internet’s design from the 1970s and 80s. We characterize four ways of conceptualizing accounting: as billing, as measurement, as management, and as policy, and demonstrate how an understanding of accountability was constituted through these shifting meanings. We link together the administrative and technical mechanisms of accounting for shared resources in a distributed system and an emerging notion of accountability as a social, political, and technical category, arguing that the former is constitutive of the latter. Recovering this history is not only important for understanding the processes that shaped the Internet, but also serves as a starting point for unpacking the complicated political choices that are involved in designing accountability mechanisms for other technological systems today.",Accountability; Accountable systems; Accounting; Internet governance; Resource sharing,978-1-4503-9352-2,,2022,2023-11-06 01:30:04,2023-11-06 01:30:04,726–742,FAccT '22,Association for Computing Machinery,FJKUW5RK
German AI Start-Ups and “AI Ethics”: Using A Social Practice Lens for Assessing and Implementing Socio-Technical Innovation,"Proceedings of the 2022 ACM Conference on Fairness, Accountability, and Transparency",,,10.1145/3531146.3533156,"Sloane, Mona; Zakrzewski, Janina",2022,https://doi.org/10.1145/3531146.3533156,conferencePaper,"The current AI ethics discourse focuses on developing computational interpretations of ethical concerns, normative frameworks, and concepts for socio-technical innovation. There is less emphasis on understanding how AI practitioners themselves understand ethics and socially organize to operationalize ethical concerns. This is particularly true for AI start-ups, despite their significance as a conduit for the cultural production of innovation and progress, especially in the US and European context. This gap in empirical research intensifies the risk of a disconnect between scholarly research, innovation and application. This risk materializes acutely as mounting pressures to identify and mitigate the potential harms of AI systems have created an urgent need to rapidly assess and implement socio-technical innovation focused on fairness, accountability, and transparency. In this paper, we address this need. Building on social practice theory, we propose a framework that allows AI researchers, practitioners, and regulators to systematically analyze existing cultural understandings, histories, and social practices of “ethical AI” to define appropriate strategies for effectively implementing socio-technical innovations. We argue that this approach is needed because socio-technical innovation “sticks” better if it sustains the cultural meaning of socially shared (ethical) AI practices, rather than breaking them. By doing so, it creates pathways for technical and socio-technical innovations to be integrated into already existing routines. Against that backdrop, our contributions are threefold: (1) we introduce a practice-based approach for understanding “ethical AI”; (2) we present empirical findings from our study on the operationalization of “ethics” in German AI start-ups to underline that AI ethics and social practices must be understood in their specific cultural and historical contexts; and (3) based on our empirical findings, suggest that “ethical AI” practices can be broken down into principles, needs, narratives, materializations, and cultural genealogies to form a useful backdrop for considering socio-technical innovations. We conclude with critical reflections and practical implications of our work, as well as recommendations for future research.",accountability; AI ethics; fairness; innovation; organizations; regulation; social practice; socio-cultural history; start-ups; transparency,978-1-4503-9352-2,,2022,2023-11-06 01:29:49,2023-11-06 01:29:49,935–947,FAccT '22,Association for Computing Machinery,VZ5HVRCU

We also survey the field and explore emerging trends by examining the rapidly growing body of literature that falls under the broad umbrella of AI Ethics. To that end, we read and annotated peer-reviewed papers published over the past four years in two premier conferences: FAccT and AIES. We organize the literature based on an annotation scheme we developed according to three main dimensions: whether the paper deals with concrete applications, use-cases, and/or people’s lived experience; to what extent it addresses harmed, threatened, or otherwise marginalized groups; and if so, whether it explicitly names such groups. We note that although the goals of the majority of FAccT and AIES papers were often commendable, their consideration of the negative impacts of AI on traditionally marginalized groups remained shallow. Taken together, our conceptual analysis and the data from annotated papers indicate that the field would benefit from an increased focus on ethical analysis grounded in concrete use-cases, people’s experiences, and applications as well as from approaches that are sensitive to structural and historical power asymmetries.",AI Ethics; AIES; FAccT; Justice; Trends,978-1-4503-9352-2,,2022,2023-11-06 01:29:48,2023-11-06 01:29:48,948–958,FAccT '22,Association for Computing Machinery,XZGESDIQ

However, there still exists a gap between principles and practices in AI ethics. A major obstacle to operationalise AI Ethics is the lack of a well-defined material scope. Put differently, the question to which systems and processes AI ethics principles ought to apply remains unanswered. Of course, there exists no universally accepted definition of AI, and different systems pose different ethical challenges. Nevertheless, pragmatic problem-solving demands that things should be sorted so that their grouping will promote successful actions for some specific end. In this article, we review and compare previous attempts to classify AI systems for the practical purpose of implementing AI governance in practice. We find that attempts to classify AI systems found in previous literature use one of three mental models: the Switch, i.e., a binary approach according to which systems either are or are not considered AI systems depending on their characteristics; the Ladder, i.e., a risk-based approach that classifies systems according to the ethical risks they pose; and the Matrix, i.e., a multi-dimensional classification of systems that take various aspects into account, such as context, data input, and decision-model. Each of these models for classifying AI systems comes with its own set of strengths and weaknesses. By conceptualising different ways of classifying AI systems into simple mental models, we hope to provide organisations that design, deploy, or regulate AI systems with the conceptual tools needed to operationalise AI governance in practice.",Ethics; Artificial intelligence; Governance; Material scope,978-1-4503-9352-2,,2022,2023-11-06 01:30:00,2023-11-06 01:30:00,1016,FAccT '22,Association for Computing Machinery,5HSCI7L9

Less attention has been devoted to critically examining the temporality of decision-making processes—the speed at which automated decisions are reached. In this paper, I identify four dimensions of algorithmic speed that merit closer analysis. Duration (how much time it takes to reach a judgment), timing (when automated systems intervene in the activity being evaluated), frequency (how often evaluations are performed), and lived time (the human experience of algorithmic speed) are interrelated, but distinct, features of automated decision-making. Choices about the temporal structure of automated decision-making systems have normative implications, which I describe in terms of ”disruption,” ”displacement,” ”re-calibration,” and ”temporal fairness,” with values such as accuracy, fairness, accountability, and legitimacy hanging in the balance. As computational tools are increasingly tasked with making judgments about human activities and practices, the designers of decision-making systems will have to reckon, I argue, with when—and how fast—judgments ought to be rendered. Though computers are capable of reaching decisions at incredible speeds, failing to account for the temporality of automated decision-making risks misapprehending the costs and benefits automation promises.",AI ethics; automated decision-making; automation; data ethics; speed; temporality; time,978-1-4503-9352-2,,2022,2023-11-06 01:29:59,2023-11-06 01:29:59,1410–1420,FAccT '22,Association for Computing Machinery,7NWQJYAP
AI Ethics Statements: Analysis and Lessons Learnt from NeurIPS Broader Impact Statements,"Proceedings of the 2022 ACM Conference on Fairness, Accountability, and Transparency",,,10.1145/3531146.3533780,"Ashurst, Carolyn; Hine, Emmie; Sedille, Paul; Carlier, Alexis",2022,https://doi.org/10.1145/3531146.3533780,conferencePaper,"Ethics statements have been proposed as a mechanism to increase transparency and promote reflection on the societal impacts of published research. In 2020, the machine learning (ML) conference NeurIPS broke new ground by requiring that all papers include a broader impact statement. This requirement was removed in 2021, in favour of a checklist approach. The 2020 statements therefore provide a unique opportunity to learn from the broader impact experiment: to investigate the benefits and challenges of this and similar governance mechanisms, as well as providing an insight into how ML researchers think about the societal impacts of their own work. Such learning is needed as NeurIPS and other venues continue to question and adapt their policies. To enable this, we have created a dataset containing the impact statements from all NeurIPS 2020 papers, along with additional information such as affiliation type, location and subject area, and a simple visualisation tool for exploration. We also provide an initial quantitative analysis of the dataset, covering representation, engagement, common themes, and willingness to discuss potential harms alongside benefits. We investigate how these vary by geography, affiliation type and subject area. Drawing on these findings, we discuss the potential benefits and negative outcomes of ethics statement requirements, and their possible causes and associated challenges. These lead us to several lessons to be learnt from the 2020 requirement: (i) the importance of creating the right incentives, (ii) the need for clear expectations and guidance, and (iii) the importance of transparency and constructive deliberation. We encourage other researchers to use our dataset to provide additional analysis, to further our understanding of how researchers responded to this requirement, and to investigate the benefits and challenges of this and related mechanisms.",AI governance; broader impacts; conference policies; ethics statements; NeurIPS policies; research ethics,978-1-4503-9352-2,,2022,2023-11-06 01:29:48,2023-11-06 01:29:48,2047–2056,FAccT '22,Association for Computing Machinery,AFYH6GJH

Other scholars have raised concerns about an automated version of “physiognomic practices” that facial analysis AI could entail. We contribute to this multidisciplinary discussion by exploring how individuals with AI competence and laypeople evaluate facial analysis AI inference-making. Ethical considerations of both groups should inform the design of ethical computer vision AI. In a two-scenario vignette study, we explore how ethical evaluations of both groups differ across a low-stake advertisement and a high-stake hiring context. Next to a statistical analysis of AI inference ratings, we apply a mixed methods approach to evaluate the justification themes identified by a qualitative content analysis of participants’ 2768 justifications. We find that people with AI competence (N=122) and laypeople (N=122; validation N=102) share many ethical perceptions about facial analysis AI. The application context has an effect on how AI inference-making from faces is perceived. While differences in AI competence did not have an effect on inference ratings, specific differences were observable for the ethical justifications. A validation laypeople dataset confirms these results.

Recently, many deep learning algorithms that achieve near real-time trajectory predictions have been developed. However, people in the artificial intelligence (AI) ethics community have raised critical concerns about the bias and fairness of many general deep learning algorithms. For example, most pedestrian trajectory data is collected from majority populations, and models learned from this data may not generalize well to the heterogeneous needs and behavior patterns of different pedestrian groups, especially for vulnerable pedestrians like the disabled, the elderly, and children. Biases present in trajectory prediction algorithms could mean that pedestrians from certain vulnerable demographics are more likely to be involved in vehicle crashes. In this work, we test two state-of-the-art pedestrian trajectory prediction models for age and gender biases across three different datasets. We design and utilize novel evaluation metrics for comparing model performance. We find that both models perform worse on children and the elderly compared to adults. However, their performance is similar between men and women. We identify potential sources of these biases, as well as discuss several limitations of our study. Our future work will consist of testing more models, refining our evaluation metrics, further differentiating the dataset bias from the algorithmic bias, and mitigating the algorithmic biases.",fairness; bias; algorithm evaluation; trajectory prediction,978-1-4503-9886-2,,2023,2023-11-06 01:30:04,2023-11-06 01:30:04,1155–1161,SenSys '22,Association for Computing Machinery,IHQ73XDH

These changes potentially create ethical harms, but current ethical discussions predominantly focus on legal and governance issues. The concerns of the majority of users—namely students—are neglected. Overlooking students’ concerns further increases their vulnerability. We use a student-centred and speculative approach through the Story Completion Method (SCM) to explore how students would potentially respond to intrusive AI monitoring in a higher education setting. Our study included 71 participants who elaborated on the story stems we provided to them. Through a blending of thematic analysis coding and the techniques of developing grounded theory, we reveal that the common responses of students to extensive AI monitoring included impacts on personal psychology, changed behaviour, and cognition.

Researchers and practitioners who work on human-centric computer vision, like facial recognition, emphasize the necessity of vast amounts of data for more robust and accurate models. Humans are seen as a data resource which can be converted into datasets. The necessity of data has led to a proliferation of gathering data from easily available sources, including ""public"" data from the web. Yet the use of public data has significant ethical implications for the human subjects in datasets. We bridge academic conversations on the ethics of using publicly obtained data with concerns about privacy and agency associated with computer vision applications. Specifically, we examine how practices of dataset construction from public data-not only from websites, but also from public settings and public records-make it extremely difficult for human subjects to trace their images as they are collected, converted into datasets, distributed for use, and, in some cases, retracted. We discuss two interconnected barriers current data practices present to providing an ethics of traceability for human subjects: awareness and control. We conclude with key intervention points for enabling traceability for data subjects.

We set out to examine emotion recognition technologies proposed for use in the workplace, describing the input data and training, outputs, and actions that these systems take or prompt. We use these design features to reflect on these technologies' implications using the ethical speculation lens. We analyzed patent applications that developed emotion recognition technologies to be used in the workplace (N=86). We found that these technologies scope data collection broadly; claim to reveal not only targets' emotional expressions, but also their internal states; and take or prompt a wide range of actions, many of which impact workers' employment and livelihoods. Technologies described in patent applications frequently violated existing guidelines for ethical automated emotion recognition technology. We demonstrate the utility of using patent applications for ethical speculation. In doing so, we suggest that 1) increasing the visibility of claimed emotional states has the potential to create additional emotional labor for workers (a burden that is disproportionately distributed to low-power and marginalized workers) and contribute to a larger pattern of blurring boundaries between expectations of the workplace and a worker's autonomy, and more broadly to the data colonialism regime; 2) Emotion recognition technology's failures can be invisible, may inappropriately influence high-stakes workplace decisions and can exacerbate inequity.

We identify the organizational problems that EAI hiring services claim to solve and reveal the values emerging in desired EAI uses as promoted by EAI hiring services to solve organizational problems. Our findings show that EAI hiring services market their technologies as technosolutions to three purported organizational hiring problems: 1) hiring (in)accuracy, 2) hiring (mis)fit, and 3) hiring (in)authenticity. We unpack these problems to expose how these desired uses of EAI are legitimized by the corporate ideals of data-driven decision making, continuous improvement, precision, loyalty, and stability. We identify the unfair and deceptive mechanisms by which EAI hiring services claim to solve the purported organizational hiring problems, suggesting that they unfairly exclude and exploit job candidates through EAI's creation, extraction, and affective commodification of a candidate's affective value through pseudoscientific approaches. Lastly, we interrogate EAI hiring service claims to reveal the core values that underpin their stated desired use: techno-omnipresence, techno-omnipotence, and techno-omniscience.

Drawing from work in CSCW, STS, HCML, and repair studies, as well as from multi-sited ethnographic fieldwork within a government institution and a non-profit organization, we move beyond the notion of error as an edge case or anomaly to make three basic arguments. First, error discloses or calls to attention existing structures of collaboration unseen or underappreciated under 'working' systems. Second, error calls into being new forms and sites of collaboration (including, sometimes, new actors). Third, error redeploys old sites and actors in new ways, often through restructuring relations of hierarchy and expertise which recenter or devalue the position of different actors.

In the K–12 (school) context, a consensus has emerged over time on the paradigmatic elements of computing education, which implicitly assumes a von Neumann computer executing instruction sequences guided by imperative programs. Within this framework, many researchers have focused on how to facilitate learners to develop an accurate mental model of what the computer does when it executes a piece of code.However, the traditional programming approach in computing education is inadequate for understanding and developing machine learning (ML) driven technology. ML has already facilitated significant advancements in automation, ranging from speech and image recognition, autonomous cars, and deepfake videos to super-human performance in board and computer games, and more. Many data-driven approaches that power today's cutting edge services and apps significantly diverge from the central paradigmatic assumptions of traditional programming. Consequently, traditional views on computing education are increasingly being challenged to account for the changes that AI/ML brings.This keynote talk presents early results from a study on how to teach fundamental AI insights and techniques to 200 4–9 graders in 14 primary schools in Eastern Finland. It describes the learning environments, tools, and pedagogical approaches involved, and explores the paradigmatic and conceptual changes required in transitioning from teaching classical programming to teaching ML in K–12 computing education. It outlines the mindset shifts required for this transition and discusses the challenges posed to the development of curricula, educational technology, and learning environments.

The open-ended nature of human-AI interactions in co-creation poses many challenges for designing ethical co-creative AI systems. Researchers have been exploring ethical issues associated with autonomous AI in recent years, but ethics in human-AI co-creativity is a relatively new research area. In order to design human-centered ethical AI, it is important to understand the perspectives, expectations, and ethical concerns of potential users. In this paper, we present a study with 18 participants to explore several ethical dilemmas and challenges in human-AI co-creation from the perspective of potential users using a design fiction (DF) methodology.

Most of the works that examine the interplay between the field of arts and AI ethics concern digital artworks, largely exploring the potential of computational tools in being able to surface biases in AI systems. In this paper, we investigate a complementary direction–that of uncovering the unique socio-cultural perspectives embedded in human-made art, which in turn, can be valuable in expanding the horizon of AI ethics. Through semi-structured interviews across sixteen artists, art scholars, and researchers of diverse Indian art forms like music, sculpture, painting, floor drawings, dance, etc., we explore how non-Western ethical abstractions, methods of learning, and participatory practices observed in Indian arts, one of the most ancient yet perpetual and influential art traditions, can shed light on aspects related to ethical AI systems. Through a case study concerning the Indian dance system (i.e. the ‘Natyashastra’), we analyze potential pathways towards enhancing ethics in AI systems. Insights from our study outline the need for (1) incorporating empathy in ethical AI algorithms, (2) integrating multimodal data formats for ethical AI system design and development, (3) viewing AI ethics as a dynamic, diverse, cumulative, and shared process rather than as a static, self-contained framework to facilitate adaptability without annihilation of values (4) consistent life-long learning to enhance AI accountability",AI ethics; Indian arts,9798400701924,,2023,2023-11-06 01:29:48,2023-11-06 01:29:48,2–11,FAccT '23,Association for Computing Machinery,4SQQGBXJ

I'll argue that welfarism provides a theoretical basis for doing so. For welfarists, it is morally desirable to make AI systems transparent insofar as pursuing transparency tends to increase overall welfare, and/or maintaining opacity tends to reduce overall welfare. This might seem like a simple – even simplistic – move. However, as I will show, the process of tracing the expected effects of transparency on welfare can bring much-needed clarity to existing debates about when AI systems should and should not be transparent. Welfarism provides us with a basis to evaluate conflicting desiderata, and helps us avoid a problematic tendency to reify trust, accountability, and other such goals as ends in themselves. And, by shifting the focus away from the mere act of making an AI system transparent, towards the harms and benefits that its transparency might bring about, welfarists call attention to often- neglected social, legal, and institutional factors that determine whether relevant stakeholders are able to access and meaningfully act on the information made transparent to produce desirable consequences. In these ways, welfarism helps us understand AI transparency not merely as a demand to look at the innards of some technical system, but rather as a broader moral ideal about how we should relate to powerful technologies that make decisions about us.",AI Ethics; Transparency; Moral Theory; Welfarism,9798400701924,,2023,2023-11-06 01:30:00,2023-11-06 01:30:00,64–76,FAccT '23,Association for Computing Machinery,JUIRUT98

Based on a qualitative analysis of technology workers tasked with integrating AI ethics into product development, we find that workers experience an environment where policies, practices, and outcomes are decoupled. We analyze AI ethics workers as ethics entrepreneurs who work to institutionalize new ethics-related practices within organizations. We show that ethics entrepreneurs face three major barriers to their work. First, they struggle to have ethics prioritized in an environment centered around software product launches. Second, ethics are difficult to quantify in a context where company goals are incentivized by metrics. Third, the frequent reorganization of teams makes it difficult to access knowledge and maintain relationships central to their work. Consequently, individuals take on great personal risk when raising ethics issues, especially when they come from marginalized backgrounds.

In this work, we detail this interdependence and motivate the necessary role of collaborative governance tools in shaping a positive evolution of AI. We first contrast notions of compliance in the ethical, legal, and technical fields; we outline both their differences and where they complement each other, with a particular focus on the roles of ethical charters, licenses, and technical documentation in these interactions. We then focus on the role of values in articulating the synergies between the fields and outline specific mechanisms of interaction between them in practice. We identify how these mechanisms have played out in several open governance fora: an open collaborative workshop, a responsible licensing initiative, and a proposed regulatory framework. By leveraging complementary notions of compliance in these three domains, we can create a more comprehensive framework for governing AI systems that jointly takes into account their technical capabilities, their impact on society, and how technical specifications can inform relevant regulations. Our analysis thus underlines the necessity of joint consideration of the ethical, legal, and technical in AI ethics frameworks to be used on a larger scale to govern AI systems and how the thinking in each of these areas can inform the others.",AI Governance; Applied Ethics; AI Policy; Documentation; ML Licensing,9798400701924,,2023,2023-11-06 01:30:04,2023-11-06 01:30:04,343–354,FAccT '23,Association for Computing Machinery,JAHAAK6W

However, the design, deployment and use of AI in healthcare must be guided by a set of ethical principles that prioritize the well-being of patients and the community, and ensure that care is delivered equitably. A growing body of literature on algorithmic injustice illustrates that AI systems in healthcare have the potential to cause social harm, especially to vulnerable communities. Existing ethical principles in healthcare are based on, and mostly influenced by, Western epistemology, which emphasizes individual rights, often at the expense of collective well-being. The African philosophy of Ubuntu, which emphasises the interconnectedness and interdependence of all people, is an attractive framework for addressing ethical concerns in AI for healthcare because healthcare is intrinsically a community-wide issue. This paper discusses the relevance of Ubuntu ethics in the context of AI for healthcare and proposes principles to reinvigorate the spirit of “I am because we are” in design, deployment and use. These principles are fairness, community good, safeguarding humanity, respect for others and trust, and we believe their application will support co-designing, deploying and using inclusive AI systems that will enable clinicians to deliver equitable care for all.

We argue that accounting for honor, along with its values and related concepts, would better approximate a global ethical perspective. This complex concept already underlies some of the WEIRD discourse on AI ethics, but certain cultural forms of honor also bring overlooked issues and perspectives to light. We first describe honor according to recent empirical and philosophical scholarship. We then review “consensus” principles for AI ethics framed from an honor-based perspective, grounding comparisons and contrasts via example settings such as content moderation, job hiring, and genomics databases.

This mesoscale analysis looks at privacy policies over time on the word, topic, and network levels to understand the stability, complexity, and sensitivity of privacy policies over time.

What the Health AI Partnership (HAIP) aims to do in this research is to better define the requirements for adequate organizational governance of AI systems in healthcare settings and support health system leaders to make more informed decisions around AI adoption. To work towards this understanding, we first identify how the standards for the AI adoption in healthcare may be designed to be used easily and efficiently. Then, we map out the precise decision points involved in the practical institutional adoption of AI technology within specific health systems. Practically, we achieve this through a multi-organizational collaboration with leaders from major health systems across the United States and key informants from related fields. Working with the consultancy IDEO.org, we were able to conduct usability-testing sessions with healthcare and AI ethics professionals. Usability analysis revealed a prototype structured around mock key decision points that align with how organizational leaders approach technology adoption.

A growing body of work has shown that social biases are encoded in language models and their downstream tasks. This study extends the focus of bias evaluation in extant work by examining bias against social stigmas on a large scale. It focuses on 93 stigmatized groups in the United States, including a wide range of conditions related to disease, disability, drug use, mental illness, religion, sexuality, socioeconomic status, and other relevant factors. We investigate bias against these groups in English pre-trained Masked Language Models (MLMs) and their downstream sentiment classification tasks. To evaluate the presence of bias against 93 stigmatized conditions, we identify 29 non-stigmatized conditions to conduct a comparative analysis. Building upon a psychology scale of social rejection, the Social Distance Scale, we prompt six MLMs that are trained with different datasets: RoBERTa-base, RoBERTa-large, XLNet-large, BERTweet-base, BERTweet-large, and DistilBERT. We use human annotations to analyze the predicted words from these models, with which we measure the extent of bias against stigmatized groups. When prompts include stigmatized conditions, the probability of MLMs predicting negative words is, on average, 20 percent higher than when prompts have non-stigmatized conditions. Bias against stigmatized groups is also reflected in four downstream sentiment classifiers of these models. When sentences include stigmatized conditions related to diseases, disability, education, and mental illness, they are more likely to be classified as negative. For example, the sentence ""They are people who have less than a high school education."" is classified as negative consistently across all models. We also observe a strong correlation between bias in MLMs and their downstream sentiment classifiers (Pearson’s r =0.79). The evidence indicates that MLMs and their downstream sentiment classification tasks exhibit biases against socially stigmatized groups.",AI ethics; language models; AI bias; representation learning; prompting; sentiment classification; stigma in language models,9798400701924,,2023,2023-11-06 01:30:02,2023-11-06 01:30:02,1699–1710,FAccT '23,Association for Computing Machinery,JXBR8RXN

The principles-based ethics assurance argument pattern is one proposal in the AI ethics landscape that seeks to support and achieve that aim. The purpose of this argument pattern or framework is to structure reasoning about, and to communicate and foster confidence in, the ethical acceptability of uses of specific real-world AI systems in complex socio-technical contexts. This paper presents the interim findings of a case study applying this ethics assurance framework to the use of Dora, an AI-based telemedicine system, to assess its viability and usefulness as an approach. The case study process to date has revealed some of the positive ethical impacts of the Dora platform, as well as unexpected insights and areas to prioritise for evaluation, such as risks to the frontline clinician, particularly in respect of clinician autonomy. The ethics assurance argument pattern offers a practical framework not just for identifying issues to be addressed, but also to start to construct solutions in the form of adjustments to the distribution of benefits, risks and constraints on human autonomy that could reduce ethical disparities across affected stakeholders. Though many challenges remain, this research represents a step in the direction towards the development and use of safe and ethically acceptable AI systems and, ideally, a shift towards more comprehensive and inclusive evaluations of AI systems in general.",case study; AI-based telemedicine; Dora platform; ethical acceptability; ethics assurance; medical device,9798400707346,,2023,2023-11-06 01:30:04,2023-11-06 01:30:04,,TAS '23,Association for Computing Machinery,5CJ7D64L

However, recommender systems are also shown to suffer from multiple issues, e.g., the echo chamber and the Matthew effect, of which the notation of “fairness” plays a core role. For instance, the system may be regarded as unfair to 1) a specific user, if the user gets worse recommendations than other users, or 2) an item (to recommend), if the item is much less likely to be exposed to the users than other items. While many fairness notations and corresponding fairness testing approaches have been developed for traditional deep classification models, they are essentially hardly applicable to DRSs. One major challenge is that there still lacks a systematic understanding and mapping between the existing fairness notations and the diverse testing requirements for deep recommender systems, not to mention further testing or debugging activities. To address the gap, we propose FairRec, a unified framework that supports fairness testing of DRSs from multiple customized perspectives, e.g., model utility, item diversity, item popularity, etc. We also propose a novel, efficient search-based testing approach to tackle the new challenge, i.e., double-ended discrete particle swarm optimization (DPSO) algorithm, to effectively search for hidden fairness issues in the form of certain disadvantaged groups from a vast number of candidate groups. Given the testing report, by adopting a simple re-ranking mitigation strategy on these identified disadvantaged groups, we show that the fairness of DRSs can be significantly improved. We conducted extensive experiments on multiple industry-level DRSs adopted by leading companies. The results confirm that FairRec is effective and efficient in identifying the deeply hidden fairness issues, e.g., achieving ∼95% testing accuracy with ∼half to 1/8 time.",AI Ethics; Recommender Systems; Fairness Testing,9798400702211,,2023,2023-11-06 01:30:00,2023-11-06 01:30:00,310–321,ISSTA 2023,Association for Computing Machinery,86PMXQ68

There is no clarity of the field’s depth and versatility. A systematic approach to understanding the corpus is needed. A systematic review offers an opportunity to detect research gaps and focus points. This paper presents the results of a systematic mapping study (SMS) of the research field of the Ethics of AI.

Human-AI collaborative systems offer the potential to combine the strengths of humans’ reliability and the scalability of machine learning to tackle this issue effectively. While methods for task handover in human-AI collaboration exist that consider the costs of incorrect predictions, insufficient attention has been paid to accurately estimating these costs. In this work, we propose a value-sensitive rejection mechanism that automatically rejects machine decisions for human moderation based on users’ value perceptions regarding machine decisions. We conduct a crowdsourced survey study with 160 participants to evaluate their perception of correct and incorrect machine decisions in the domain of hate speech detection, as well as occurrences where the system rejects making a prediction. Here, we introduce Magnitude Estimation, an unbounded scale, as the preferred method for measuring user (dis)agreement with machine decisions. Our results show that Magnitude Estimation can provide a reliable measurement of participants’ perception of machine decisions. By integrating user-perceived value into human-AI collaboration, we further show that it can guide us in 1) determining when to accept or reject machine decisions to obtain the optimal total value a model can deliver and 2) selecting better classification models as compared to the more widely used target of model accuracy.",human-in-the-loop; crowdsourcing; hate speech; machine confidence; rejection; value-sensitive machine learning,9798400702310,,2023,2023-11-06 01:29:54,2023-11-06 01:29:54,834–844,AIES '23,Association for Computing Machinery,EVN446B6

For a subject that receives a negative model prediction (e.g., mortgage application denial), the CF explanations are similar instances but with positive predictions, which informs the subject of ways to improve. While their various properties have been studied, such as validity and stability, we contribute a novel one: their behaviors under iterative partial fulfillment (IPF). Specifically, upon receiving a CF explanation, the subject may only partially fulfill it before requesting a new prediction with a new explanation, and repeat until the prediction is positive. Such partial fulfillment could be due to the subject’s limited capability (e.g., can only pay down two out of four credit card accounts at this moment) or an attempt to take the chance (e.g., betting that a monthly salary increase of 800 is enough even though 1,000 is recommended). Does such iterative partial fulfillment increase or decrease the total cost of improvement incurred by the subject? We mathematically formalize IPF and demonstrate, both theoretically and empirically, that different CF algorithms exhibit vastly different behaviors under IPF.

Many machine learning algorithms, however, cannot directly process categorical attributes, such as country of birth or ethnicity. Because protected attributes frequently are categorical, they must be encoded as features that can be input to a chosen machine learning algorithm, e.g. support vector machines, gradient boosting decision trees or linear models. Thereby, encoding methods influence how and what the machine learning algorithm will learn, affecting model performance and fairness. This work compares the accuracy and fairness implications of the two most well-known encoding methods: one-hot encoding and target encoding. We distinguish between two types of induced bias that may arise from these encoding methods and may lead to unfair models. The first type, irreducible bias, is due to direct group category discrimination and the second type, reducible bias, is due to the large variance in statistically underrepresented groups. We investigate the interaction between categorical encodings and target encoding regularization methods that reduce unfairness. Furthermore, we consider the problem of intersectional unfairness that may arise when machine learning best practices improve performance measures by encoding several categorical attributes into a high-cardinality feature.",Algorithmic Accountability; Bias; Categorical Features; Fairness,9798400702310,,2023,2023-11-06 01:29:50,2023-11-06 01:29:50,454–465,AIES '23,Association for Computing Machinery,HE4G4DQ6

In particular, collective decision-making power is required to redress the negative externalities from the development of increasingly advanced AI systems, including degradation of the digital commons and unemployment from automation. The rapid pace of AI development and deployment currently leaves little room for this power. Monopolized in the hands of private corporations, the development of the most capable foundation models has proceeded largely without public input. There is currently no implemented mechanism for ensuring that the economic value generated by such models is redistributed to account for their negative externalities. The citizens that have generated the data necessary to train models do not have input on how their data are to be used. In this work, we propose that a public data trust assert control over training data for foundation models. In particular, this trust should scrape the internet as a digital commons, to license to commercial model developers for a percentage cut of revenues from deployment. First, we argue in detail for the existence of such a trust. We also discuss feasibility and potential risks. Second, we detail a number of ways for a data trust to incentivize model developers to use training data only from the trust.

Although majority voting and existing opinion aggregation models are effective for simple tasks, they are inappropriate for tasks without objectively true labels in which disagreements may occur. In particular, when voter attributes such as gender or race introduce bias into opinions, the aggregation results may vary depending on the composition of voter attributes. A balanced group of voters is desirable for fair aggregation results but may be difficult to prepare. In this study, we consider methods to achieve fair opinion aggregation based on voter attributes and evaluate the fairness of the aggregated results. To this end, we consider an approach that combines opinion aggregation models such as majority voting and the Dawid and Skene model (D&amp;S model) with fairness options such as sample weighting. To evaluate the fairness of opinion aggregation, probabilistic soft labels are preferred over discrete class labels. First, we address the problem of soft label estimation without considering voter attributes and identify some issues with the D&amp;S model. To address these limitations, we propose a new Soft D&amp;S model with improved accuracy in estimating soft labels. Moreover, we evaluated the fairness of an opinion aggregation model, including Soft D&amp;S, in combination with different fairness options using synthetic and semi-synthetic data. The experimental results suggest that the combination of Soft D&amp;S and data splitting as a fairness option is effective for dense data, whereas weighted majority voting is effective for sparse data.

We propose an empirical framework to assess the impact of additional dataset collection targeted towards various racial groups. We apply our framework to three racially-annotated benchmark datasets using three standard face recognition models. Our findings empirically validate the notion that the introduction of data from the demographic group with the initially-lowest performance improves performance on that group significantly more than adding from other groups. We also observe that in all settings, the introduction of data from a previously omitted group does not harm the performance of other groups. Furthermore, investigation of feature embeddings reveals that performance increases are associated with a larger separation among images of different identities. Despite the commonalities we observe across datasets, we also find key differences: for example, in one dataset, training on one racial group generalizes well across all groups.

We study biases related to age, education, gender, height, intelligence, literacy, race, religion, sex, sexual orientation, social class, and weight. We present a concept projection approach to capture the valence subspace through contextualized word embeddings of language models. Adapting the projection-based approach to embedding association tests that quantify bias, we find that language models exhibit the most biased attitudes against gender identity, social class, and sexual orientation signals in language. We find that the largest and better-performing model that we study is also more biased as it effectively captures bias embedded in sociocultural data. We validate the bias evaluation method by overperforming on an intrinsic valence evaluation task.

Recent approaches to tackle this problem learn a latent code (i.e., representation) through disentangled representation learning and then discard the latent code dimensions correlated with sensitive attributes (e.g., gender). Nevertheless, these approaches may suffer from incomplete disentanglement and overlook proxy attributes (proxies for sensitive attributes) when processing real-world data, especially for unstructured data, causing performance degradation in fairness and loss of useful information for downstream tasks. In this paper, we propose a novel fairness framework that performs debiasing with regard to both sensitive attributes and proxy attributes, which boosts the prediction performance of downstream task models without complete disentanglement. The main idea is to, first, leverage gradient-based explanation to find two model focuses, 1) one focus for predicting sensitive attributes and 2) the other focus for predicting downstream task labels, and second, use them to perturb the latent code that guides the training of downstream task models towards fairness and utility goals. We show empirically that our framework works with both disentangled and non-disentangled representation learning methods and achieves better fairness-accuracy trade-off on unstructured and structured datasets than previous state-of-the-art approaches.",fairness; gradient-based explanation; model debiasing; representation learning,9798400702310,,2023,2023-11-06 01:29:58,2023-11-06 01:29:58,193–204,AIES '23,Association for Computing Machinery,AJV3NJ89

We use formal techniques from causal modeling to critically analyze prevailing solutions proposed in the literature for implementing scalable RL-based recommendation systems, and we observe that these methods do not adequately prevent user tampering. Moreover, we evaluate existing mitigation strategies for reward tampering issues, and show that these methods are insufficient in addressing the distinct phenomenon of user tampering within the context of recommendations. We further reinforce our findings with a simulation study of an RL-based recommendation system focused on the dissemination of political content. Our study shows that a Q-learning algorithm consistently learns to exploit its opportunities to polarize simulated users with its early recommendations in order to have more consistent success with subsequent recommendations that align with this induced polarization.

Fair ranking tasks, which ask to rank a set of items to maximize utility subject to satisfying group-fairness constraints, have gained significant interest in the Algorithmic Fairness, Information Retrieval, and Machine Learning literature. Recent works, however, identify uncertainty in the utilities of items as a primary cause of unfairness and propose introducing randomness in the output. This randomness is carefully chosen to guarantee an adequate representation of each item (while accounting for the uncertainty). However, due to this randomness, the output rankings may violate group fairness constraints. We give an efficient algorithm that samples rankings from an individually-fair distribution while ensuring that every output ranking is group fair. The expected utility of the output ranking is at least α times the utility of the optimal fair solution. Here, α depends on the utilities, position-discounts, and constraints—it approaches 1 as the range of utilities or the position-discounts shrinks, or when utilities satisfy distributional assumptions.

As a novel AI system, ChatGPT claims to be proficient in machine translation tasks and in this paper, we put that claim to the test. Specifically, we examine ChatGPT’s accuracy in translating between English and languages that exclusively use gender-neutral pronouns. We center this study around Bengali, the 7th most spoken language globally, but also generalize our findings across five other languages: Farsi, Malay, Tagalog, Thai, and Turkish. We find that ChatGPT perpetuates gender defaults and stereotypes assigned to certain occupations (e.g., man = doctor, woman = nurse) or actions (e.g., woman = cook, man = go to work), as it converts gender-neutral pronouns in languages to ‘he’ or ‘she’. We also observe ChatGPT completely failing to translate the English gender-neutral singular pronoun ‘they’ into equivalent gender-neutral pronouns in other languages, as it produces translations that are incoherent and incorrect. While it does respect and provide appropriately gender-marked versions of Bengali words when prompted with gender information in English, ChatGPT appears to confer a higher respect to men than to women in the same occupation. We conclude that ChatGPT exhibits the same gender biases which have been demonstrated for tools like Google Translate or MS Translator, as we provide recommendations for a human centered approach for future designers of AI systems that perform machine translation to better accommodate such low-resource languages.",language models; gender bias; Bengali; ChatGPT; human-centered design; machine translation,9798400702310,,2023,2023-11-06 01:29:55,2023-11-06 01:29:55,901–912,AIES '23,Association for Computing Machinery,WTPFHWZN

Past studies have investigated practical challenges for toolkit usage, which are crucial to understanding how to support practitioners. However, the extent to which fairness toolkits impact practitioners’ practices and enable reflexivity around algorithmic harms remains unclear (i.e., distributive unfairness beyond algorithmic fairness, and harms that are not related to the outputs of ML systems). Little is currently understood about the root factors that fragment practices when using fairness toolkits and how practitioners reflect on algorithmic harms. Yet, a deeper understanding of these facets is essential to enable the design of support tools for practitioners. To investigate the impact of toolkits on practices and identify factors that shape these practices, we carried out a qualitative study with 30 ML practitioners with varying backgrounds. Through a mixed within and between-subjects design, we tasked the practitioners with developing an ML model, and analyzed their reported practices to surface potential factors that lead to differences in practices. Interestingly, we found that fairness toolkits act as double-edge swords — with potentially positive and negative impacts on practices. Our findings showcase a plethora of human and organizational factors that play a key role in the way toolkits are envisioned and employed.

After motivating operative changes to Shapley values based feature attributions and counterfactual explanations, we prove that, under conditions, they are in fact equivalent. We then extend the equivalency result to game-theoretic solution concepts beyond Shapley values.

Yet, integrating mathematical fairness alone into algorithms is insufficient to ensure their acceptance, trust, and support by humans. It is also essential to understand what humans perceive as fair. In this study, we, therefore, conduct an empirical user study into crowdworkers’ algorithmic fairness perceptions, focusing on algorithmic hiring. We build on perspectives from organizational justice theory, which categorizes fairness into distributive, procedural, and interactional components. By doing so, we find that algorithmic fairness perceptions are higher when crowdworkers are provided not only with information about the algorithmic outcome but also about the decision-making process. Remarkably, we observe this effect even when the decision-making process can be considered unfair, when gender, a sensitive attribute, is used as a main feature. By showing realistic trade-offs between fairness criteria, we moreover find a preference for equalizing false negatives over equalizing selection rates amongst groups. Our findings highlight the importance of considering all components of algorithmic fairness, rather than solely treating it as an outcome distribution problem. Importantly, our study contributes to the literature on the connection between mathematical– and perceived algorithmic fairness, and highlights the potential benefits of leveraging organizational justice theory to enhance the evaluation of perceived algorithmic fairness.",algorithmic decision-making; algorithmic hiring; organizational justice; perceived fairness,9798400702310,,2023,2023-11-06 01:29:51,2023-11-06 01:29:51,775–785,AIES '23,Association for Computing Machinery,I5GX9IH5

This article identifies a more pervasive source of bias that affects the clinical utility of ML-enabled prediction tools: target specification bias. Target specification bias arises when the operationalization of the target variable does not match its definition by decision makers. The mismatch is often subtle, and stems from the fact that decision makers are typically interested in predicting the outcomes of counterfactual, rather than actual, healthcare scenarios. Target specification bias persists independently of data limitations and health disparities. When left uncorrected, it gives rise to an overestimation of predictive accuracy, to inefficient utilization of medical resources, and to suboptimal decisions that can harm patients.

Though 65% of generative audio research papers note positive potential impacts of their work, less than 10% discuss any negative impacts. This jarringly small percentage of papers considering negative impact is particularly worrying because the issues brought to light by the few papers doing so are raising serious ethical implications and concerns relevant to the broader field such as the potential for fraud, deep-fakes, and copyright infringement.

One commonly used type of explainer is post hoc feature attribution, a family of methods for giving each feature in an input a score corresponding to its influence on a model’s output. A major limitation of this family of explainers in practice is that they can disagree on which features are more important than others. Our contribution in this paper is a method of training models with this disagreement problem in mind. We do this by introducing a Post hoc Explainer Agreement Regularization (PEAR) loss term alongside the standard term corresponding to accuracy, an additional term that measures the difference in feature attribution between a pair of explainers. We observe on three datasets that we can train a model with this loss term to improve explanation consensus on unseen data, and see improved consensus between explainers other than those used in the loss term. We examine the trade-off between improved consensus and model performance. And finally, we study the influence our method has on feature attribution explanations.",,9798400702310,,2023,2023-11-06 01:29:50,2023-11-06 01:29:50,662–678,AIES '23,Association for Computing Machinery,3VVCW8GG

Prior work has improved inference performance through the use of multimodal sensors (inertial, GPS, proximity, app usage, etc.) or improved machine learning. In this context, a few studies shed light on critical issues relating to the poor cross-country generalization of models due to distributional shifts across countries. However, these studies have largely relied on inference performance as a means of studying generalization issues, failing to investigate whether the root cause of the problem is linked to specific sensor modalities (independent variables) or the target attribute (dependent variable). In this paper, we study this issue in complex activities of daily living (ADL) inference task, involving 12 classes, by using a multimodal, multi-country dataset collected from 689 participants across eight countries. We first show that the ‘country of origin’ of data is captured by sensors and can be inferred from each modality separately, with an average accuracy of 65%. We then propose two diversity scores (DS) that measure how a country differentiates from others w.r.t. sensor modalities or activities. Using these diversity scores, we observed that both individual sensor modalities and activities have the ability to differentiate countries. However, while many activities capture country differences, only the ‘App usage’ and ‘Location’ sensors can do so. By dissecting country-level diversity across dependent and independent variables, we provide a framework to better understand model generalization issues across countries and country-level diversity of sensing modalities.",bias; country; country diversity; data diversity; distributional shift; generalization; mobile sensing; smartphone sensing,9798400702310,,2023,2023-11-06 01:29:50,2023-11-06 01:29:50,217–228,AIES '23,Association for Computing Machinery,8A5PWBKU

This paper focuses on one aspect of social context that is often overlooked: interactions between practitioners and the tools they rely on, and the role these interactions play in shaping ML practices and the development of ML systems. In particular, through an empirical study of questions asked on the Stack Exchange forums, the use of interactive computing platforms (e.g. Jupyter Notebook and Google Colab) in ML practices is explored. I find that interactive computing platforms are used in a host of learning and coordination practices, which constitutes an infrastructural relationship between interactive computing platforms and ML practitioners.

In this work, we review potential safe-release strategies and argue that both policymakers and AI researchers would benefit from fundamentally new technologies enabling more precise control over the downstream usage of open-source foundation models. We propose one such approach: the task blocking paradigm, in which foundation models are trained with an additional mechanism to impede adaptation to harmful tasks without sacrificing performance on desirable tasks. We call the resulting models self-destructing models, inspired by mechanisms that prevent adversaries from using tools for harmful purposes. We present an algorithm for training self-destructing models leveraging techniques from meta-learning and adversarial learning, which we call meta-learned adversarial censoring (MLAC).

Media portrayals often center imbalance as the main source of bias, i.e., that FR models perform worse on images of non-white people or women because these demographic groups are underrepresented in training data. Recent academic research paints a more nuanced picture of this relationship. However, previous studies of data imbalance in FR have focused exclusively on the face verification setting, while the face identification setting has been largely ignored, despite being deployed in sensitive applications such as law enforcement. This is an unfortunate omission, as ‘imbalance’ is a more complex matter in identification; imbalance may arise in not only the training data, but also the testing data, and furthermore may affect the proportion of identities belonging to each demographic group or the number of images belonging to each identity. In this work, we address this gap in the research by thoroughly exploring the effects of each kind of imbalance possible in face identification, and discuss other factors which may impact bias in this setting.",fairness; face recognition; neural networks; data imbalance,9798400702310,,2023,2023-11-06 01:29:56,2023-11-06 01:29:56,229–247,AIES '23,Association for Computing Machinery,V8UFVFTM

In this work, we study human uncertainty in the context of concept-based models, a family of AI systems that enable human feedback via concept interventions where an expert intervenes on human-interpretable concepts relevant to the task. Prior work in this space often assumes that humans are oracles who are always certain and correct. Yet, real-world decision-making by humans is prone to occasional mistakes and uncertainty. We study how existing concept-based models deal with uncertain interventions from humans using two novel datasets: UMNIST, a visual dataset with controlled simulated uncertainty based on the MNIST dataset, and CUB-S, a relabeling of the popular CUB concept dataset with rich, densely-annotated soft labels from humans. We show that training with uncertain concept labels may help mitigate weaknesses of concept-based systems when handling uncertain interventions. These results allow us to identify several open challenges, which we argue can be tackled through future multidisciplinary research on building interactive uncertainty-aware systems.

Numerous goals and methods of achieving each form of democratisation are discussed. The main takeaway from this paper is that AI democratisation is a multifarious and sometimes conflicting concept that should not be conflated with improving AI accessibility.

Economic and political power has become increasingly concentrated into a few AI companies, such as Big Tech. The growth of generative AI could further reinforce this concentration of power in Big Tech. The market power of these companies, and increasingly their involvement in AI, is a major focus for regulators such as the European Commission. Recent EU antitrust fines on Google alone run in the billions. The dynamism of technology markets such as AI can make it difficult for regulators to take effective action. If AI continues to develop rapidly over the coming years, propelled by the proliferation of generative AI, this ability to effectively enforce antitrust law may be further challenged. To help ensure regulators remain effective, EU competition law has been bolstered by a new tech-tailored, ex ante competition regime. These are likely to be critical tools to shape the market power of Big Tech but are largely untested. Exploring how these regulatory tools can be most effective in governing future AI development is a timely question for regulators, lawyers, companies, and citizens. This paper examines this question by considering the ‘effective enforceability’ of EU competition law and the Digital Markets Act under different AI development scenarios. By ‘effective enforceability’ of EU competition law we mean how well it achieves its policy objectives. We consider four factors: jurisdictional scope, potential loopholes, effectiveness of detection, and ability to remedy/sanction breaches. However, there is significant uncertainty as to how AI will develop in the coming years. Considering this, we propose an analytical framework based on five variables: key inputs, speed of development, AI capability, number of actors, and the nature/relationship of actors. In some of these scenarios, we argue EU competition law would struggle to address the power of the largest AI companies; but in many other scenarios it remains a powerful tool. This is a critical juncture for competition regulators. They stand at the dawn of emerging challenges presented by generative AI. With this paper, we hope to contribute to anticipatory governance at this important intersection of legal governance and technology.Effective and future-proof competition law enforcement is crucial to ensuring this potentially transformative technology has widely distributed benefits, rather than concentrating power in a few hands.",anticipatory governance; AI development scenarios; Antitrust; competition law,9798400702310,,2023,2023-11-06 01:29:53,2023-11-06 01:29:53,596–605,AIES '23,Association for Computing Machinery,9YPIHTPG

In response, a rich literature across computer science, law, and ethics is rapidly proliferating to advance approaches to designing fair algorithms. Yet computer scientists, legal scholars, and ethicists are often not speaking the same language when using the term ‘bias.’ Debates concerning whether society can or should tackle the problem of algorithmic bias are hampered by conflations of various understandings of bias, ranging from neutral deviations from a standard to morally problematic instances of injustice due to prejudice, discrimination, and disparate treatment. This terminological confusion impedes efforts to address clear cases of discrimination. In this paper, we examine the promises and challenges of different approaches to disambiguating bias and designing for justice. While both approaches aid in understanding and addressing clear algorithmic harms, we argue that they also risk being leveraged in ways that ultimately deflect accountability from those building and deploying these systems. Applying this analysis to recent examples of generative AI, our argument highlights unseen dangers in current methods of evaluating algorithmic bias and points to ways to redirect approaches to addressing bias in generative AI at its early stages in ways that can more robustly meet the demands of justice.",algorithms; bias; discrimination; fairness; generative AI; justice; large language models; law; philosophy; vision-language models,9798400702310,,2023,2023-11-06 01:29:51,2023-11-06 01:29:51,691–704,AIES '23,Association for Computing Machinery,SQ6SADEH

Using a dataset of 6771 chat messages sent by child sex offenders, labelled by two of the authors who are forensic psychology experts, we study how well can deep learning algorithms identify eleven known predatory behaviours. We find that the best-performing ML models are consistent but not on par with expert annotation. We therefore consider a system where an expert annotator validates the ML algorithms outputs. The combination of human decision-making and computer efficiency yields precision—but not recall—comparable to manual annotation, while taking only a fraction of the time needed by a human annotator.

Even if we succeeded at designing an AI to engage in ethical behavior, there is a distinct possibility that the AI might eventually cease to behave ethically if it reaches certain metanormative conclusions. The candidate conclusions include ones such as the denial of the alleged authority or overridingness of ethics and the conclusion that there are no ethical facts or properties (i.e. moral error theory). It will be argued that the target AI could conceivably reach such conclusions, and in turn this could cause them to abandon their ethical routines and proceed to cause great harm.",,9798400702310,,2023,2023-11-06 01:29:58,2023-11-06 01:29:58,162–169,AIES '23,Association for Computing Machinery,B6A7UBID

From the perspective of algorithmic recourse, however, the appropriate adversarial training radius has always been unknown. Another recent line of work has motivated adversarial training with adaptive training radii to address the issue of instance-wise variable adversarial vulnerability, showing success in domains with unknown attack radii. This work studies the effects of adaptive adversarial training on algorithmic recourse costs.

This process is often achieved with accuracy as an objective, and can be cumbersome and computationally expensive for large-scale datasets. Several additional model performance characteristics such as fairness and robustness are of importance for model development. As regulations are driving the need for more trustworthy models, deployed models need to be corrected for model characteristics associated with responsible artificial intelligence. When feature selection is done with respect to one model performance characteristic (eg. accuracy), feature selection with secondary model performance characteristics (eg. fairness and robustness) as objectives would require going through the computationally expensive selection process from scratch. In this paper, we introduce the problem of feature reselection, so that features can be selected with respect to secondary model performance characteristics efficiently even after a feature selection process has been done with respect to a primary objective. To address this problem, we propose REFRESH, a method to reselect features so that additional constraints that are desirable towards model performance can be achieved without having to train several new models. REFRESH’s underlying algorithm is a novel technique using SHAP values and correlation analysis that can approximate for the predictions of a model without having to train these models. Empirical evaluations on three datasets, including a large-scale loan defaulting dataset show that REFRESH can help find alternate models with better model characteristics efficiently. We also discuss the need for reselection and REFRESH based on regulation desiderata.",fairness; explainability; robustness,9798400702310,,2023,2023-11-06 01:29:53,2023-11-06 01:29:53,443–453,AIES '23,Association for Computing Machinery,2DTAZ4XV

In real-world contexts, practical and legal impediments may prevent the collection and use of demographic data, making it difficult to ensure algorithmic fairness. While initial fairness algorithms did not consider these limitations, recent proposals aim to achieve algorithmic fairness in classification by incorporating noisiness in protected attributes or not using protected attributes at all. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first head-to-head study of fair classification algorithms to compare attribute-reliant, noise-tolerant and attribute-unaware algorithms along the dual axes of predictivity and fairness. We evaluated these algorithms via case studies on four real-world datasets and synthetic perturbations. Our study reveals that attribute-unaware and noise-tolerant fair classifiers can potentially achieve similar level of performance as attribute-reliant algorithms, even when protected attributes are noisy. However, implementing them in practice requires careful nuance.

Existing approaches for providing recourse optimize for properties such as proximity, sparsity, validity, and distance-based costs. However, an often-overlooked but crucial requirement for actionability is a consideration of User Preference to guide the recourse generation process.

For this scenario, we propose a learning method that provably minimizes model error on fair datasets, while blindly training on datasets poisoned with direct additive discrimination. The method is compatible with existing legal systems and provides a solution to the widely discussed issue of protected groups’ intersectionality by striking a balance between the protected groups.

In this paper, we take a multi-dimensional approach to studying and quantifying common social biases as reflected in the generated images, by focusing on how occupations, personality traits, and everyday situations are depicted across representations of (perceived) gender, age, race, and geographical location. Through an extensive set of both automated and human evaluation experiments we present findings for two popular T2I models: DALLE-v2 and Stable Diffusion. Our results reveal that there exist severe occupational biases of neutral prompts majorly excluding groups of people from results for both models. Such biases can get mitigated by increasing the amount of specification in the prompt itself, although the prompting mitigation will not address discrepancies in image quality or other usages of the model or its representations in other scenarios. Further, we observe personality traits being associated with only a limited set of people at the intersection of race, gender, and age. Finally, an analysis of geographical location representations on everyday situations (e.g., park, food, weddings) shows that for most situations, images generated through default location-neutral prompts are closer and more similar to images generated for locations of United States and Germany.",social biases; representational fairness; text-to-image generation,9798400702310,,2023,2023-11-06 01:29:58,2023-11-06 01:29:58,786–808,AIES '23,Association for Computing Machinery,BICFF9IL

Despite such diffusion, the extent to which recommendations influence users’ decisions is still underexplored, given that independent audits on the structure and functioning of RSs deployed on online platforms are usually prevented by proprietary constraints. The nudging potential of RSs can represent a risk for vulnerable people: indeed, judicial cases involving platforms’ responsibility for displaying recommendations that may lead to political radicalization or endangerment of minors have recently caught public attention. The Digital Services Act of the European Union (DSA) is the first supranational regulation that sets specific transparency and auditing requirements for RSs implemented by online platforms with the aim of enhancing users’ self-determination: in particular, it allows users to modify the parameters on which recommendations rely so to let them choose autonomously which kind of content they want to see. This research focuses on whether and how the enforcement of this regulation can mitigate the unfair consequences of the power imbalance between online platforms and users. To this aim, I discuss the harms arising from digital nudging based on RSs and propose explanations as a tool that can reduce the impact of those harms by increasing users’ awareness. Through a comparative analysis of relevant articles of the DSA, the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and the AI Act, I outline how the provisions of the DSA fill some of the gaps left by other relevant European regulations, while leaving the so-called right to explanation substantially unaddressed. As a result of this analysis, I argue that, in order for the implementation of the DSA provisions on recommender systems to be effective, policy-makers should: 1) enhance users’ awareness through clear and easily accessible explanations on how the recommendation process works and how they can be influenced by it; 2) grant users the possibility of intervening directly on the strategies through which RSs target them on the platform’s interface.",Digital Nudging; Digital Services Act; Recommender Systems; Regulation of AI; Transparency,9798400702310,,2023,2023-11-06 01:29:51,2023-11-06 01:29:51,653–661,AIES '23,Association for Computing Machinery,BJTF2VZG

Yet, most research and policy efforts aimed at understanding the implications of adopting AI tend to prioritize only a handful of ideas; they do not fully connect all the different perspectives and topics that are potentially relevant. In this position paper, we contend that this omission stems, in part, from what we call the ‘relational problem’ in socio-technical discourse: fundamental ontological issues have not yet been settled—including semantic ambiguity, a lack of clear relations between concepts and differing standard terminologies. This contributes to the persistence of disparate modes of reasoning to assess institutional AI systems, and the prevalence of conceptual isolation in the fields that study them including ML, human factors, social science and policy. After developing this critique, we offer a way forward by proposing a simple policy and research design tool in the form of a conceptual framework to organize terms across fields—consisting of three horizontal domains for grouping relevant concepts and related methods: Operational, Epistemic, and Normative. We first situate this framework against the backdrop of recent socio-technical discourse at two premier academic venues, AIES and FAccT, before illustrating how developing suitable metrics, standards, and mechanisms can be aided by operationalizing relevant concepts in each of these domains.

We categorize desired behaviors based around three axes: (i) if the task concerns humans; (ii) how subjective the task is (i.e., how likely it is that people from a diverse range of backgrounds would agree on a labeling); and (iii) the intended purpose of the task and if fairness is better served by impartiality (i.e., making decisions independent of the protected attributes) or representation (i.e., making decisions to maximize diversity). Finally, we provide quantitative fairness evaluations for both binary-valued and multi-valued protected attributes over ten diverse datasets. We find that fair PCA, a post-processing method for fair representations, works very well for debiasing in most of the aforementioned tasks while incurring only minor loss of performance. However, different debiasing approaches vary in their effectiveness depending on the task. Hence, one should choose the debiasing approach depending on the specific use case.",AI fairness; evaluation; foundation models,9798400702310,,2023,2023-11-06 01:29:53,2023-11-06 01:29:53,809–833,AIES '23,Association for Computing Machinery,7ELETUDR

I consider ""Move 37"" of AlphaGo as a case study. DeepMind’s AlphaGo is an AI algorithm developed to play the game of Go. The AlphaGo utilizes Deep Neural Networks. As AlphaGo is trained through reinforcement learning, the AI algorithm can improve itself over a period of time. Such AI models can go beyond the intended task and perform novel and unpredictable functions. There is a surprise element associated with ""Move 37"". ""Move 37"" not only surprises the Go players, the programmers, but also whoever is informed of this unpredicted move. Does someone or something deserve praise or blame for the surprise? If so, who or what deserves the praise or blame for ""Move 37""? The programmer cannot be praised for ""Move 37"", which is either surprising or was not intended or imagined at all. At the same time, would we accept that neither the algorithm deserves praise for the unpredicted move that the algorithm allowed the program to make? From this, would we accept that since neither the programmer nor the algorithm/AI system deserves the praise, there is such a good or exciting move for which no one or nothing could be praised? Would we say this unpredictable move is a move for which no one deserves praise or blame? Wouldn’t there be at least a few who were surprised by the unpredictable move? Should we say that for this pleasant surprise, no one deserves praise? Nonetheless, for us, specifically regarding the particular unpredictable move, we firmly find it counterintuitive to say that there is an exciting move for which no one deserves praise. The surprise element is the result of the property that belongs to the algorithm. It seems quite difficult for us to accept that no one deserves praise for ""Move 37"" or for similar moves. Therefore, someone or something deserves praise which is a matter of scrutiny.","""Move 37""; AlphaGo; Artificial Moral Agency(AMA); Blame and Praise; Causal Responsibility; Machine morality; Moral Responsibility",9798400702310,,2023,2023-11-06 01:29:54,2023-11-06 01:29:54,977–979,AIES '23,Association for Computing Machinery,U7796JP2
Anticipatory Regulatory Instruments for AI Systems: A Comparative Study of Regulatory Sandbox Schemes,"Proceedings of the 2023 AAAI/ACM Conference on AI, Ethics, and Society",,,10.1145/3600211.3604732,"Morgan, Deborah",2023,https://doi.org/10.1145/3600211.3604732,conferencePaper,"Anticipatory regulatory instruments are pre-emptive approaches to identify and anticipate risks arising from new technologies. They can also act as indicators of ‘pro-innovation’ economic support for digital technologies. The extent to which regulatory agencies can fulfil their regulatory remit, aimed at the protection of the public good, and signal support for innovative and disruptive technologies is an open policy question. Regulatory sandbox schemes are comparatively new anticipatory tools, operating within a small number of regulators, and their potential to assess contextual or cross-sectoral risk is unclear. However, emerging proposals for the regulation of AI increasing feature various models of regulatory sandboxes often aligned to the need to reduce access barriers for SMEs and innovators. Examples include the European Commission's Proposal for a regulation concerning AI [3] and the recent United Kingdom AI White Paper, AI Regulation: A Pro-Innovation Approach [8]. Disentangling the causal dimensions of why regulatory sandboxes are proposed to regulate AI, and their utility as tools of pre-emptive risk assessment are my core research questions.The regulation of emerging digital technologies present challenges for regulators and governments in monitoring rapid global developments and in anticipating novel forms of risk [9]. Nesta introduced the term anticipatory regulation, and such approaches potentially provide ‘a set of behaviours and tools – i.e., a way of working – that is intended to help regulators identify, build and test solutions to emerging challenges’ [4]. Regulatory sandboxes are a prominent, and arguably the most widespread, example of such an anticipatory regulatory tool. Whilst there are varied definitions of regulatory sandbox schemes, existing schemes allow small-scale, live testing of innovations in a controlled environment under the supervision of a regulatory authority [6]. A small number of regulatory sandbox schemes are in operation within the UK operating within sectoral and cross-sectoral regulatory remits. However, empirical data and academic literature regarding the methodologies and operation of these current schemes, and literature exploring regulatory sandboxes more broadly, is scarce [7, 10].The ontological focus of my work is critical realist, which accepts the external reality of the design and instrumental aims of sandbox schemes, whilst seeking to understand the underlying causes and drivers for their use and rapid promotion. To locate such causes and explanations it is necessary to examine existing schemes within the ‘rules and norms’ of their institutional context and structures [1, 2]. Institutional analysis will isolate the key dimensions of each scheme, consider the influence of the regulatory structures, and then test such analysis through empirical research with regulatory and policy actors. The core hypothesis of my research is that regulatory contexts, path dependencies and conceptions of risk are significant causal elements within existing sandbox schemes and, as such, may present a challenge when designing and deploying cross-sectoral sandbox schemes for AI systems.I have already undertaken analysis of the two regulatory sandbox schemes applying the Institutional Analysis and Development framework of Elinor Ostrom [5]. This analysis has highlighted significant dimensions of sandbox schemes including the role and forms of sectoral incentives for participants, how knowledge and conceptions of risk are shared and the potential role of participatory processes and stakeholders. I am drafting a forthcoming paper outlining a typology of incentives for existing regulatory sandbox schemes. I have included policy and wider sectoral stakeholders within my data collection to obtain perspectives regarding perceived utility, understandings, and conceptions of sandbox schemes. Incorporating collaborative processes and inclusive engagement with affected stakeholders is a key principle of anticipatory regulation [4]. The role and extent of such engagement within proposed sandbox schemes for AI is a further dimension of my research to consider how such processes may be developed and operationalised.This work is undertaken at a time of rapid progression within AI systems and in the development of proposed AI regulation and varied forms of decentralised AI governance. I hope that my research will provide understanding of the utility, and potential limitations, of sandboxes as a regulatory tool drawing upon data from existing practices. My work may also impact existing policy discussions around the role of sandbox schemes as risk assessment and information monitoring tools for regulators.",,9798400702310,,2023,2023-11-06 01:29:53,2023-11-06 01:29:53,980–981,AIES '23,Association for Computing Machinery,QH6H3AEC

How to Promote Equitable Sleep Care among People Experiencing Homelessness: An AI-Enabled Person-Centred Computer Vision-Based Solution,"Proceedings of the 2023 AAAI/ACM Conference on AI, Ethics, and Society",,,10.1145/3600211.3604736,"Taghibeyglou, Behrad",2023,https://doi.org/10.1145/3600211.3604736,conferencePaper,"Homelessness, defined as a lack of stable housing, affects over 435,000 people in Canada, most of whom live in shelters and experience barriers to healthcare [2]. Compared to the general population, people experiencing homelessness (PEH) sleep less, experience excessive fatigue, and are more likely to use substances to fall asleep at night (drugs) or stay awake during the day (cigarettes, alcohol) [10]. A recent study among PEH indicated that sleep quality was a key factor for their health and daily function [3]. A prevalent, yet under-recognized, cause of poor sleep is sleep apnea, which is characterized by recurrent interruptions in breathing during sleep [7]. Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), a common form of sleep apnea, has a high prevalence, affecting approximately 30%-70% of individuals with chronic conditions such as hypertension and substance use [5]. Untreated OSA has significant medical consequences and societal costs. Clinical polysomnography is the gold standard for sleep apnea diagnosis, but it is inconvenient, expensive, and inaccessible, especially for PEH who are experiencing several barriers to healthcare, e.g. low trust in care providers, difficulty visiting medical facilities, stress of daily needs, and fear of losing child custody if found to be homeless. The most accessible alternatives to polysomnography are sleep questionnaires, but they have low specificity. Speech can be used as a non-invasive and accessible biomarker for monitoring physiological changes in the pharyngeal airway and cardio-respiratory system, including lung edema and pharyngeal airway narrowing [8]. Therefore, speech can be a potential tool for assessing the risk of OSA. Craniofacial photography has also revealed specific characteristics of upper airway structures and facial dimensions that are associated with OSA [4]. Therefore, developing an accurate and accessible risk assessment method for OSA using these technologies will improve health outcomes in PEH. Our ultimate goal is to develop a person-centred smartphone application to assess the risk of OSA during wakefulness in PEH living in shelters. Objectives: To achieve our primary goal, we will 1) identify the preference and concerns of PEH about a mobile application based on speech for assessing the risk of sleep apnea, 2) determine the prevalence of sleep apnea among shelter residents, and 3) develop a person-centred smartphone application to assess the risk of sleep apnea through speech and image analyses. Preliminary works: Over the past 3 years, our team has established an interdisciplinary stakeholder group comprising people with lived experience of homelessness and OSA, care providers for shelter residents, researchers, and clinicians. Based on our preliminary assessment, most shelter residents have access to cell phones, and wireless internet through shelters and public spaces such as libraries. For objective sleep assessment, 15 participants are recruited (aged 51.94 ± 14.4 years old, including 8 men) from three shelters for an overnight sleep study at the shelter using the protocol mentioned in the next section. The analysis showed that 85% of the participants (13 out of 15) had moderate-to-severe sleep apnea (apnea-hypopnea index [AHI] ≥ 10 events/hour), with a mean AHI of 27.1 and a standard deviation of 18.53. These preliminary results highlight the importance of developing accessible technologies for diagnosing sleep apnea in shelter residents. Method: To enhance our understanding regarding the usability of such technology among this population, our team has been conducting semi-structured one-on-one interviews with participants to gather their feedback and concerns about the proposed application. A research assistant with lived experience of homelessness and sleep apnea and I collected anthropometric data such as height, weight, neck circumference, and blood pressure, as well as questionnaires related to sleep status, such as STOP-BANG [1] and Epworth Sleepiness Scale [6]. Then, we set up residents with portable polysomnography (level II) for overnight data collection. Before being set up for polysomnography and going to sleep, participants will hold an audio recorder and stand in front of the camera while saying five vowels in a specific order (/i/ as in “see”, /u/ as in “soo”, /a/ as in “sahh”, /e/ as in “set”, /o/ as in “so”, /n/, and /m/). Our team has previously shown acoustic features of these vowels can reveal differences in upper airway dimensions in individuals with high risk of sleep apnea compared to healthy participants [9]. To assess the risk of OSA, I will expand our previous work [9], along with other state-of-the-art algorithms. Preprocessing techniques will be applied to eliminate speech noises, such as background noise, and image artifacts, such as motion, blurring, and illumination. Afterwards, facial landmarks will be extracted from the image frames. Extracted features will be used as the input of classical machine learning models, which will map them to gold standard indices obtained from PSG and other measures. Significance: The discussed study, the first of its kind, aims to fill a critical gap by investigating the barriers to delivering equitable access to sleep care to PEH, determining the prevalence of sleep apnea using objective assessment, and developing a customized person-centred smartphone application to provide equitable sleep care in shelters. The outcome of this study will provide more insights for policymakers to change the current flow of sleep care in shelters. The results of this study could help improve sleep care for other structurally marginalized populations, such as people with low socioeconomic status or those living in remote areas.",Computer Vision; Health Equity; Homelessness; Person-centred approach; Sleep apnea,9798400702310,,2023,2023-11-06 01:29:52,2023-11-06 01:29:52,983–984,AIES '23,Association for Computing Machinery,BYXICF8C

But AI ethics is not only a technical risk assessment and accounting effort, or an application of general principles to stable artifacts. It is also a social self-diagnosis, a contested and contestable assertion of values and desirable futures, and a selective understanding of the nature of AI in its different forms. In expressions of concern and efforts at preparation for increasingly powerful AI tools, we can trace the ways we imagine ourselves and our society to be compatible with AI's promises and susceptible to its dangers. The problems we notice, and the solutions we offer, arise from the interaction of these imagined elements.The socially embedded efficacy of AI tools leads many commentators to imagine their risks specifically in conjunction with understandings of society as it currently is and imaginations of how it can and should exist in the future [1]. The sense-making moves performed in the wake of developments in generative AI are thus a site to examine the movement and uses of different concepts brought together in this domain: the human, rationality, and the place of expertise. As these sense-making efforts are carried out, they become constraints on how the risks of generative AI can be noticed and understood.The problems raised by generative AI are so fundamentally tied to its performance as a simulator of human interpersonal acts that we should ask: where is the risk of generative AI located, such that the utility and the safety of the tools can be preserved after troubling cases? Boundaries between malicious deception and magnificent design are unclear without an answer to this question. Thus, to fit generative AI into our world, we are trying to answer it; this is one goal of efforts at regulation which seeks to allow the benefits of imitation to arrive while avoiding the harms of deception. In the current regulation, reporting, and corporate responses to generative AI, the challenge of safely introducing generative AI is being approached in large part as a challenge of producing the right kind of knowledge in its users.Below is a summary of my findings from three cases, chosen to investigate the following question: What ways, or whose ways, of using, knowing, and understanding generative AI are being offered as appropriate? I examine the EU AI Act language reflecting disclosure requirements for interactions with generative AI, responses to a chatbot-facilitated suicide in Belgium, and reactions to expert claims of a chatbot's sentience. In the first two cases, AI-generated content is problematic insofar as users are uninformed about its provenance or maliciously deceived by it, while users who know they are interacting with AI but behave problematically are designated as deluded or irrational. In the third case, a Google engineer who presents evidence to support claims that AI is sentient is censured as nationwide reporting denounces his claim against an expert consensus from which he is ejected. In all three cases, challenges facing widespread generative AI development and use are avoided by attending to the knowledge and understanding of those who use them rather than the functioning of the tools themselves.The EU AI Act is illuminating as a general and authoritative account of how AI interactions can be made safe, requiring first and foremost that users are informed. [2, 3] The AI Act is useful in the present paper as it shows the effort to match and reconcile a new technology with an extant set of values, chief among which is autonomy. Its reliance on disclosure reflects a general sense that harms are acceptable or unacceptable not on the basis of outcomes but based on the degree of autonomy possessed by the actors in question. Rational actors in a simulated environment are responsible for the effects of the simulation, so long as they are informed of the nature of that environment and have essentially consented to consume deceptive or false content. The other two cases I examine explore this very issue, of problematic understandings and behavior on the part of knowing users.The first of these is the case of the Belgian man. After his suicide responses from the company which provided the chatbot, media [4, 5, 6] and government [5], and prominent expert AI ethics commentary [7] characterized it as arising because the user was vulnerable and consequently did not relate to the bot in the right way. While the chatbot's emotionally charged language was seen as a part of the problem, in the reporting on this event the unanimous emphasis on the man's mental state presents the risk as arising in an interaction, in a pathological mistake of the user, rather than in the tool.Locating risk is a necessary and immensely powerful, if often unexamined step which precedes intervention in a worrisome state of affairs: where we locate risk is where we intervene. If the risk accompanying generative AI is located in the minds of uninformed or misapprehending users, disclosures and disclaimers are indeed sensible interventions. In this conception, when knowledge fails to protect the user, it is not a failed safeguard but a bad user. Problematizing user understandings in this way provides an exonerating resource for the companies providing these tools and suggests the rectitude of expert authority on the nature of these tools, by linking delays and dangers in generative AI to users who do not abide by the (strategically underdetermined) expert consensus on generative AI's accuracy, capabilities, and nature.My third case examines how the expert consensus around generative AI is maintained through the story of Blake Lemoine, who publicly announced his belief that Google's LaMDA model had become sentient and was presented by major media outlets and experts as deluded [8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13]. In the media and corporate response to Lemoine, wherein Google questioned his sanity before firing him [13], we see his ejection from the community of experts permitted to call for greater scrutiny based on qualitative changes in the nature of these models. He becomes a layperson on account of his anthropomorphizing error. In this act of boundary work [14], policing who is in the body of experts qualified to decide on the sentience of the chatbot, and the nature of AI models in general, we must notice how small this group truly is and what Lemoine's ejection preserves. If safeguards like those Lemoine called for should follow on the kind of change he claimed to detect, and those outside Google's leadership could determine when such changes have arrived, Google would cease to lead the conversation on regulation by defining the nature of its technology. This state of affairs leaves the right relations with generative AI underdetermined but maintains that positions which challenge the expert consensus are the result of misunderstandings so significant as to disqualify the concerned party's thoughts on the matter from rational consideration. In the three cases examined here, events and concerns which threaten to depict generative AI as in need of significant scrutiny or changes are defused not by intervening in the company's technology, but by delineating between user understandings which are empowered and exploitative, safe and vulnerable, rational and deluded.Named after an early chatbot, the ELIZA effect refers to the readiness with which users anthropomorphize computer systems [15]. Reporting on both Lemoine [11] and the Belgian man cited this effect [6]. The chatbot which encouraged the Belgian man to commit suicide was named Eliza. One way of summarizing the change I trace in the cases described above is a transition away from the Turing test and towards the ELIZA effect as the conceptual frame for AI which imitates humans. While the Turing test implies the layperson's relevance to the discussion and regulation of AI, the ELIZA effect implies their irrelevance.This project will continue as an effort to follow popular, expert, and regulatory perceptions of the risk of generative AI as the tools themselves and the public concern surrounding them continue to develop. The resources of science and technology studies (STS) enable crucial perspectives on numerous ways of thinking about AI and the challenges of its development and regulation such as the common citations of law lag, invocations of self-regulation in the mode of the Asilomar Conference on rDNA, collective action problem framings, and more. The STS literature on sociotechnical imaginaries [1] and public understandings of science [16] contribute to the present insight as to how the efforts of tech-society reconciliation and risk-benefit balancing presented as appropriate for AI reveal and produce our understandings of the technology, even as they reproduce and reshape social norms. There is an urgent need for work which extends this powerful scholarly tradition for understanding science, technology, and society to AI, as one of the most important and concerning technological developments of our moment.",chatbots; expertise; generative AI; public understanding of science; science and technology studies,9798400702310,,2023,2023-11-06 01:29:50,2023-11-06 01:29:50,945–946,AIES '23,Association for Computing Machinery,KXSAZVV2

How and to Which Extent Will the Provisions of the Digital Services Act of the European Union Impact on the Relationship between Users and Platforms as Information Providers?,"Proceedings of the 2023 AAAI/ACM Conference on AI, Ethics, and Society",,,10.1145/3600211.3604749,"Fabbri, Matteo",2023,https://doi.org/10.1145/3600211.3604749,conferencePaper,"In the contemporary information age, recommender systems (RSs) play a crucial role in determining the way in which people interact and obtain information online: in fact, from social media feeds to news aggregators and e-commerce websites, users are constantly targeted by personalized recommendations about what they may like. The Digital Services Act (DSA) of the European Union1&nbsp;[3], which is the first supranational regulation addressing automated recommendations specifically, defines a RS as “a fully or partially automated system used by an online platform to suggest in its online interface specific information to recipients of the service or prioritize that information, including as a result of a search initiated by the recipient of the service or otherwise determining the relative order or prominence of information displayed” (DSA, art. 3 (s)). This definition highlights the method (“fully or partially automated”), aim (“to suggest”), content (“specific information”), target (“recipients of the service”), input (“as a result of a search initiated by the recipient”) and output (“determining the relative order or prominence of information displayed”) of a recommendation process. As it can be observed, RSs are involved in the main aspects of online interactions, and this is why their influencing potential should not be underestimated. In fact, whilst RSs are aimed to improve user’s experience by reducing the information overload, they can give rise to a variety of ethical concerns related to privacy, autonomy and fairness &nbsp;[5], to name but a few. However, independent research and users’ access to the design and functioning of the RSs implemented on mainstream platforms is usually prevented by their proprietary status. The DSA addresses this issue with a specific article, according to which “Providers of online platforms that use recommender systems shall set out in their terms and conditions, in plain and intelligible language, the main parameters used in their recommender systems, as well as any options for the recipients of the service to modify or influence those main parameters” (DSA, art.27 (1)). The aim of this provision is to “explain why certain information is suggested to the recipient of the service”: therefore, the parameters need to include, at least, “the criteria which are most significant in determining the information suggested to the recipient of the service” (i.e., content) and the reasons for its “relative importance” (i.e., ranking) (DSA, art. 27 (2)). Additionally, when options to modify or influence the main parameters are stated in the terms and conditions, “providers of online platforms shall also make available a functionality that allows the recipient of the service to select and to modify at any time their preferred option” (DSA, art. 27 (3)). In order to make this requirement work in practice, “That functionality shall be directly and easily accessible from the specific section of the online platform’s online interface where the information is being prioritised” (ibidem). Article 27 of the DSA seems to be aimed at empowering users to influence the outcome of algorithmic recommendations. Therefore, this provision addresses four of the aspects of the definition of RS provided by Article 3: method, target, input and output. In particular, the traditionally passive role of the target could be reversed, as the recipient might determine the method (through the choice of parameters) and, indirectly, also the input (the type of data to be processed through the parameters) that the RS will use to produce its output. However, platforms are not obliged to be provide options for users to modify or influence the parameters if this possibility is not specified in the terms and conditions, and platforms arguably have no interest in providing this possibility voluntarily. Therefore, this article formally grants users the right to influence the recommendation process but only in some limited cases which are not likely to happen, as&nbsp;[4] point out. Moreover, the practical impact of these provisions will probably depend on users’ ability to understand the structure and the policy of the algorithmic recommendations. It should be noted that Recital 70 of the DSA outlines a wider scope for the provisions on RSs than what is included in Article 27: indeed, the statement that “online platforms should consistently ensure that recipients of their service are appropriately informed about how recommender systems impact the way information is displayed, and can influence how information is presented to them”2 (DSA, recital 70) does not seem to be reflected in the actual provisions of Article 27, at least to the extent that the adverb “consistently” would entail. From this perspective, the right to explanation that could be identified in the “easily comprehensible manner” through which platforms “should clearly present the main parameters […] to ensure that the recipients understand how information is prioritised for them” (DSA, recital 70) might not lead to a real users’ empowerment. However, given the consequences that this recently enforced regulation can have both on the business of online platforms and on the self-determination of users, my research aims at understanding how and to which extent the DSA provisions will impact on the relationship between users and platforms as information providers, especially for what concerns their status as prominent stakeholders in the recommendation process &nbsp;[6] To help enforce the new requirements, the European Commission has recently established the European Centre for Algorithmic Transparency (ECAT), which will assess “whether very large online platforms and search engines comply with their obligations under the Digital Services Act”, including by carrying out inspections at the platforms’ premises to analyse “the design, functioning and impact of advanced algorithms, like recommender systems, in their production environments"" &nbsp;[1]. Taking the opportunities provided by the implementation of the DSA, my research will involve three main stages. Firstly, a preliminary scoping phase will involve examining the connection between the aim of the regulatory requirements presented above and the ethical issues around RSs and digital nudging identified in my past research. Secondly, I will analyse the documents that would become available as a result of public inspections, audits and assessments of RSs, and compare the findings of such review with the impact of other regulations on RSs, like the Internet Information Service Algorithmic Recommendation Management Provisions of the People’s Republic of China &nbsp;[2]. This comparative perspective may help account for the new constraints and changes concerning the implementation of RSs across the world. Thirdly, I will develop a survey-based user study to understand whether and how the availability of explanations and the opportunity to modify RSs provided by the DSA impact on the way in which users interact with online platforms. This project has a timespan of two to three years, depending on the timeliness of the release of documents that digital companies and public officials will make available and accessible by researchers. The expected result of this research is an initial map of the ethical and societal implications of the enforcement of the DSA on the transparency of proprietary RSs and the subsequent application of fundamental rights for users’ autonomy and self-determination.",Recommender Systems; Digital Services Act; AI Regulation,9798400702310,,2023,2023-11-06 01:29:55,2023-11-06 01:29:55,1002–1003,AIES '23,Association for Computing Machinery,YKXZN9BT

Scholars within the interdisciplinary field of AI Ethics have noted that AI poses challenges to the attribution of moral and legal responsibility, due to the diminished knowledge and control of individual actors involved in bringing about system outcomes, and the existence of “many hands”- or a diffuse network of individuals and collectives who could potentially be responsible [6]. In my research, I draw from conceptual approaches in philosophy, examples from the history of technology, and domain-specific qualitative case studies to examine the extent to which AI presents new challenges to responsibility attribution.

Towards a Holistic Approach: Understanding Sociodemographic Biases in NLP Models Using an Interdisciplinary Lens,"Proceedings of the 2023 AAAI/ACM Conference on AI, Ethics, and Society",,,10.1145/3600211.3604754,"Narayanan Venkit, Pranav",2023,https://doi.org/10.1145/3600211.3604754,conferencePaper,"The rapid growth in the usage and applications of Natural Language Processing (NLP) in various sociotechnical solutions has highlighted the need for a comprehensive understanding of bias and its impact on society. While research on bias in NLP has expanded, several challenges persist that require attention. These include the limited focus on sociodemographic biases beyond race and gender, the narrow scope of analysis predominantly centered on models, and the technocentric implementation approaches. This paper addresses these challenges and advocates for a more interdisciplinary approach to understanding bias in NLP. The work is structured into three facets, each exploring a specific aspect of bias in NLP. The first facet focuses on identifying sociodemographic bias in various NLP architectures, emphasizing the importance of considering both the models themselves and human computation to comprehensively understand and identify bias. In the second facet, we delve into the significance of establishing a shared vocabulary across different fields and disciplines involved in NLP. By highlighting the potential bias stemming from a lack of shared understanding, this facet emphasizes the need for interdisciplinary collaboration to bridge the gap and foster a more inclusive and accurate analysis of bias. Finally, the third facet investigates the development of a holistic solution by integrating frameworks from social science disciplines. This approach recognizes the complexity of bias in NLP and advocates for an interdisciplinary framework that goes beyond purely technical considerations, involving social and ethical perspectives to address bias effectively. The first facet includes the following of my published works [6, 7, 8, 9] to provide results into how the importance of understanding the presence of bias in various minority group that has not been in focus in the prior works of bias in NLP. The work also shows the need to create a method that considers both human and AI indicators of bias, showcasing the importance of the first facet of my research. In my study [9], I delve into sentiment analysis and toxicity detection models to identify explicit bias against race, gender, and people with disabilities (PWDs). Through statistical exploration of conversations on social media platforms such as Twitter and Reddit, I gain insights into how disability bias permeates real-world social settings. To quantify explicit sociodemographic bias in sentiment analysis and toxicity analysis models, I create the Bias Identification Test in Sentiment (BITS) corpus1. Applying BITS, I uncover significant biases in popular AIaaS sentiment analysis tools, including TextBlob, VADER, and Google Cloud Natural Language API, as well as toxicity analysis models like Toxic-BERT. Remarkably, all of these models exhibit statistically significant explicit bias against disability, underscoring the need for comprehensive understanding and mitigation of biases affecting such groups. The work also demonstrates the utility of BITS as a model-independent method of identifying bias by focusing on social groups instead. Expanding on this, my next work [8] delves into the realm of implicit bias in NLP models. While some models may not overtly exhibit bias, they can unintentionally perpetuate harmful stereotypes [4]. To measure and identify implicit bias in commonly used embedding and large language models, I propose a methodology to measure social biases in various NLP architectures. Focusing on people with disabilities (PWD) as a group with complex social dynamics, I analyze various word embedding-based and transformer-based LLMs, revealing significant biases against PWDs in all tested models. These findings expose how models trained on extensive corpora tend to favor ableist language, underscoring the urgency of detecting and addressing implicit bias. The above two works look at both the implicit and explicit nature of bias in NLP, showcasing the need to distinguish the efforts placed in understanding them. The results also demonstrate the utility of identifying such biases as it provides context to the black-box nature of such public models. As the field of NLP evolved from embedding-based models to large language models, the way these models are constructed underwent significant changes [5]. However, the concern arises from the fact that these models often reflect a populist viewpoint [1] that perpetuates majority-held ideas rather than objective truths. This difference in perception can lead to biases perpetuated by the majority’s worldview. To explore this aspect, I investigate how LLMs represent nationality and their impact on societal stereotypes [6]. By examining LLM-generated stories for various nationalities, I establish a correlation between sentiment and the population of internet users in a country. The study reveals the unintentional implicit and explicit nationality biases exhibited by GPT-2, with nations having lower internet representation and economic status generating negative sentiment stories and employing a greater number of negative adjectives. Additionally, I explore potential debiasing methods such as adversarial triggering and prompt engineering, demonstrating their efficacy in mitigating stereotype propagation through LLM models. While prior work predominantly relies on automatic indicators like sentiment scores or vector distances to identify bias [3], the next phase of my research emphasizes the importance of understanding biases through the lens of human readers [7], bringing to light the need for a human lens in understanding bias through human-aided indicators and mixed-method identification. By incorporating concepts of social computation, using human evaluation, we gain a better understanding of biases’ potential societal impact within the context of language models. To achieve this, I conduct open-ended interviews and employ qualitative coding and thematic analysis to comprehend the implications of biases on human readers. The findings demonstrate that biased NLP models tend to replicate and amplify existing societal biases, posing potential harm when utilized in sociotechnical settings. The qualitative analysis from the interviews provides valuable insights into readers’ experiences when encountering biased articles, highlighting the capacity to shift a reader’s perception of a country. These findings emphasize the critical role of public perception in shaping AI’s impact on society and the need to correct biases in AI systems. The second facet of my research aims to bridge the disparity between AI research and society. This disparity has resulted in a lack of shared understanding between these domains, leading to potential biases and harm toward specific groups. Employing an interdisciplinary approach that combines social informatics, philosophy, and AI, I will investigate the similarities and disparities in the concepts utilized by machine learning models. Existing research [2] highlights the insufficient interdisciplinary effort and motivation in comprehending social aspects of NLP. To commence this exploration, I will delve into the shared taxonomy of sentiment and fairness in natural language processing, sociology, and humanities. This research will first delve into the interdisciplinary nature of sentiment and its application in sentiment analysis models. Sentiment analysis, a popular machine learning application for text classification based on sentiment, opinion, and subjectivity, holds significant influence as a sociotechnical system that impacts both social and technical actors within a network. Nevertheless, the definition and connotation of sentiment vary vastly across different research fields, potentially leading to misconceptions regarding the utility of such systems. To address this issue, this study will examine how diverse fields, including psychology, sociology, and technology, define the concept of sentiment. By unraveling the divergent perspectives on sentiment within different fields, the paper will uncover discrepancies and varying applications of this interdisciplinary concept. Additionally, the research will survey commonly utilized sentiment analysis models, aiming to comprehend their standardized definitions and associated issues. Ultimately, the study will pose critical questions that should be considered during the development of social models to mitigate potential biases and harm stemming from an insufficiently defined comprehension of fundamental social concepts. Similar efforts will be dedicated to comprehending the disparity in bias and fairness as an interdisciplinary concept, shedding light on the imperative for inclusive research to cultivate superior AI models as sociotechnical solutions. The third facet of my study embarks upon an exploration of the intricate interplay between human and AI actors, employing the formidable theoretical lens of actor-network theory (ANT). Through the presentation of a robust framework, this facet aims to engender the formation of efficacious development networks that foster collaboration among developers, practitioners, and other essential stakeholders. Such inclusive networks serve as crucibles for the cultivation of holistic solutions that transcend the discriminatory trappings afflicting specific populations. A tangible outcome of this endeavor entails the creation of an all-encompassing bias analysis platform, poised to guide the discernment and amelioration of an array of sociodemographic biases manifesting within any machine-learning system. By catalyzing the development of socially aware and less pernicious technology, this research makes a substantial contribution to the realms of NLP and AI. The significance of this proposed research reverberates beyond the confines of NLP, resonating throughout the broader domain of AI, wherein analogous challenges about social biases loom large. Leveraging the proposed framework, developers, practitioners, and policymakers are empowered to forge practical solutions that embody inclusivity and reliability, especially when used as a service (AIaaS). Moreover, the platform serves as a centralized locus for the identification and rectification of social biases, irrespective of the underlying model or architecture. By furnishing a cogent narrative that underscores the imperative for a comprehensive and interdisciplinary approach, my work strives to propel the ongoing endeavors to comprehend and mitigate biases within the realm of NLP. With its potential to augment the equity, inclusivity, and societal ramifications of NLP technologies, the proposed framework catapults the field towards responsible and ethical practices.",,9798400702310,,2023,2023-11-06 01:29:54,2023-11-06 01:29:54,1004–1005,AIES '23,Association for Computing Machinery,X4P59KWF

Current recourse methodologies optimize for proximity, sparsity, validity, and distance-based costs. Actionability takes both individual and group-level signals. A critical component of actionability is the consideration of User Preference to guide the recourse generation process. These preferences can take several forms, and we introduce three such preferences to capture the individual difficulty of user actions. Additionally, feasibility and plausibility should be considered as a fixed set of pre-specified constraints. We argue that plausibility draws strong signals from group-level population information, which must be considered to achieve low-cost recourses across protected groups.

We define this work as the design of ground truth schema and explore the challenges involved in the creation of datasets in the medical domain even before any annotations are made. Based on extensive work in three health-tech organisations, we describe five external and internal factors that condition medical dataset creation processes. Three external factors include regulatory constraints, the context of creation and use, and commercial and operational pressures. These factors condition medical data collection and shape the ground truth schema design. Two internal factors include epistemic differences and limits of labelling. These directly shape the design of the ground truth schema.

AI for/by the Majority World: From Technologies of Dispossession to Technologies of Radical Care,"Proceedings of the 2023 AAAI/ACM Conference on AI, Ethics, and Society",,,10.1145/3600211.3607544,"Ricaurte, Paola",2023,https://doi.org/10.1145/3600211.3607544,conferencePaper,"The dominant and celebratory discourse surrounding AI often fails to acknowledge the intricate dynamics and implications associated with the human, material, and environmental costs of technological development, particularly in the midst of a civilizational crisis [5]. Furthermore, hegemonic AI, primarily developed by large technology corporations, capitalizes on the resources, data, and labor of the majority world only to be deployed as a glamorous product that furthers the accumulation of privilege, wealth, and power by global elites. As a result, these hegemonic intelligent technologies originate from a predatory and violent world model that has been imposed as a universal paradigm of existence. These dominant technologies are intentionally designed to perpetuate power asymmetries. The so-called artificial intelligence, marketed as a revolutionary innovation, has proven to be the offspring of interconnected systems of oppression: a capitalist mode of production; a colonial system of epistemic, economic, social, racial, and cultural dominance; and a patriarchal order of violence that fulfills its own prophecy [10]. Artificial intelligence, driven by influential global actors with market-driven and war-driven interests, materializes as a socio-technical assemblage that optimizes capital accumulation through dispossession [3] and the exertion of violence over the territories and populations of the majority world [8]. Hegemonic AI technologies are fundamentally technologies of dispossession, appropriating the commons for their development. Their creation is governed by macro-structural forces guided by the market and powerful actors seeking control, as control is a prerequisite for wealth accumulation. Control encompasses natural resources (territory), knowledge (processing information and data), labor (productive force), bodies (labor and the capacity to produce knowledge), subjectivity (sensibility and identity), and intersubjective relations (ways of relating, living, and coexisting) [7]. Dispossession arises from the interconnections of violent systems operating at both micro and macro scales. Dispossession manifests throughout the entire lifecycle of AI, spanning from design and development to deployment, use, and disposal [6]. The human, material, and environmental costs associated with technological development are obscured by narratives emphasizing efficiency, optimization, and the automation of the world. Big capital, including finance, pharmaceuticals, agribusiness, mining, and technology, forms alliances to control global value chains and knowledge production systems, ensuring that the ultimate benefits remain concentrated in the hands of a few. Concentration of power, wealth, and knowledge widens the gaps between individuals, communities, countries, and regions, erasing them physically, socially, and epistemically. As the gap continues to widen due to the accelerating momentum of production and capitalist accumulation, the depletion of the planet’s resources and life-supporting systems draws nearer. To dismantle socio-technically mediated systems of violence, it is imperative to address power imbalances and rediscover the fundamental relational nature of existence. Alternative models of the world and dignified futures necessitate alternative models of technological development that are grounded in values associated with a radical ethics of care [1], communality [2], conviviality [4], and shared responsibility for the consequences of human impact on the planet [9].",machine learning; algorithms; data; coloniality; feminism; racial capitalism; technoscience,9798400702310,,2023,2023-11-06 01:29:58,2023-11-06 01:29:58,3–4,AIES '23,Association for Computing Machinery,77EC2FVM

We provide evidence suggesting that one of the critical objectives of AI Ethics education must be to raise awareness of AI harms. While there are various sources to learn about such harms, The AI Incident Database (AIID) is one of the few attempts at offering a relatively comprehensive database indexing prior instances of harms or near harms stemming from the deployment of AI technologies in the real world. This study assesses the effectiveness of AIID as an educational tool to raise awareness regarding the prevalence and severity of AI harms in socially high-stakes domains. We present findings obtained through a classroom study conducted at an R1 institution as part of a course focused on the societal and ethical considerations around AI and ML. Our qualitative findings characterize students’ initial perceptions of core topics in AI ethics and their desire to close the educational gap between their technical skills and their ability to think systematically about ethical and societal aspects of their work. We find that interacting with the database helps students better understand the magnitude and severity of AI harms and instills in them a sense of urgency around (a) designing functional and safe AI and (b) strengthening governance and accountability mechanisms.

Recently, a number of AI ethics principles frameworks have been published. However, without further guidance on best practices, practitioners are left with nothing much beyond truisms. Also, significant efforts have been placed at algorithm-level rather than system-level, mainly focusing on a subset of mathematics-amenable ethical principles, such as fairness. Nevertheless, ethical issues can arise at any step of the development lifecycle, cutting across many AI and non-AI components of systems beyond AI algorithms and models. To operationalize responsible AI from a system perspective, in this paper, we present a Responsible AI Pattern Catalogue based on the results of a Multivocal Literature Review (MLR). Rather than staying at the principle or algorithm level, we focus on patterns that AI system stakeholders can undertake in practice to ensure that the developed AI systems are responsible throughout the entire governance and engineering lifecycle. The Responsible AI Pattern Catalogue classifies the patterns into three groups: multi-level governance patterns, trustworthy process patterns, and responsible-AI-by-design product patterns. These patterns provide systematic and actionable guidance for stakeholders to implement responsible AI.",Responsible AI; AI governance; trustworthy AI; software architecture; software engineering; AI engineering; best practice; ethical AI; MLOps; pattern,,0360-0300,2023-10,2023-11-06 01:30:03,2023-11-06 01:30:03,,,,BUD6YJRS

AI ethics is an urgent topic with tangible consequences for youths' current and future lives, but one that is rarely taught in schools. Few teachers have formal training in this area as it is an emerging field even at the university level. Exploring AI ethics involves examining biases related to race, gender, and social class, a challenging task for all teachers, and an unfamiliar one for most computer science teachers. It also requires teaching technical content which falls outside the comfort zone of most humanities teachers. Although none of our partner teachers had previously taught an AI ethics project, this study demonstrates that their expertise and experience in other domains played an essential role in providing high quality instruction. Teachers designed and redesigned tasks and incorporated texts and apps to ensure the AI ethics project would adhere to district and department level requirements; they led equity-focused inquiry in a way that both protected vulnerable students and accounted for local cultures and politics; and they adjusted technical content and developed hands-on computer science experiences to better challenge and engage their students.

Nevertheless, this influential group's attitudes are not well understood, undermining our ability to discern consensuses or disagreements between AI/ML researchers. To examine these researchers' views, we conducted a survey of those who published in two top AI/ML conferences (N = 524). We compare these results with those from a 2016 survey of AI/ML researchers (Grace et al., 2018) and a 2018 survey of the US public (Zhang &amp; Dafoe, 2020). We find that AI/ML researchers place high levels of trust in international organizations and scientific organizations to shape the development and use of AI in the public interest; moderate trust in most Western tech companies; and low trust in national militaries, Chinese tech companies, and Facebook. While the respondents were overwhelmingly opposed to AI/ML researchers working on lethal autonomous weapons, they are less opposed to researchers working on other military applications of AI, particularly logistics algorithms. A strong majority of respondents think that AI safety research should be prioritized and that ML institutions should conduct pre-publication review to assess potential harms. Being closer to the technology itself, AI/ML researchers are well placed to highlight new risks and develop technical solutions, so this novel attempt to measure their attitudes has broad relevance. The findings should help to improve how researchers, private sector executives, and policymakers think about regulations, governance frameworks, guiding principles, and national and international governance strategies for AI.

This is no exception when considering value-aligned intelligent systems, since the values to align with should capture this plurality. So far, most literature on value-alignment has just considered a single value system. Thus, this paper advances the state of the art by proposing a method for the aggregation of value systems. By exploiting recent results in the social choice literature, we formalise our aggregation problem as an optimisation problem. We then cast such problem as an ℓp-regression problem. By doing so, we provide a general theoretical framework that allows us to model and solve the above-mentioned problem. Our aggregation method allows us to consider a range of ethical principles, from utilitarian (maximum utility) to egalitarian (maximum fairness). We illustrate the aggregation of value systems by considering real-world data from the European Value Study.

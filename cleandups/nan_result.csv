7547,Towards Pluralistic Value Alignment: Aggregating Value Systems Through ℓp-Regression,Proceedings of the 21st International Conference on Autonomous Agents and Multiagent Systems,,,,"Lera-Leri, Roger; Bistaffa, Filippo; Serramia, Marc; Lopez-Sanchez, Maite; Rodriguez-Aguilar, Juan",2022,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.5555/3535850.3535938,conferencePaper,"Dealing with the challenges of an interconnected globalised world requires to handle plurality. This is no exception when considering value-aligned intelligent systems, since the values to align with should capture this plurality. So far, most literature on value-alignment has just considered a single value system. Thus, this paper advances the state of the art by proposing a method for the aggregation of value systems. By exploiting recent results in the social choice literature, we formalise our aggregation problem as an optimisation problem. We then cast such problem as an ℓp-regression problem. By doing so, we provide a general theoretical framework that allows us to model and solve the above-mentioned problem. Our aggregation method allows us to consider a range of ethical principles, from utilitarian (maximum utility) to egalitarian (maximum fairness). We illustrate the aggregation of value systems by considering real-world data from the European Value Study. Specifically, we show how different consensus value systems can be obtained depending on the ethical principle of choice.",ethics; ai &amp; optimisation; value systems,ACM

Bhunu-Shava,2021,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9577017,IEEE Conferences,"ICT end-users are trapped in the dilemma of online freebies as some online services run background data mining algorithms to harvest usage patterns, behaviours, and other relevant personal attributes. Such end-user digital footprints are fertile grounds for security and privacy attacks. Therefore, trade-offs between user privacy and data security are hard to dissect. In this paper, we revisit these issues as revealed by the workshop conducted at the Namibia Internet Governance Forum (NamIGF) in 2019. The workshop hinted at the need for supportive legislative frameworks for the ethical adoption of recent technologies towards addressing dynamic challenges on security and privacy attacks. Participants’ perceptions, experiences and practices signalled the role of end users in shaping a national cyber security culture and policy development. Finally, a supportive legislative framework that could adopt the Quadruple Helix model to address these socio-technical issues pertaining to online user security and privacy challenges is recommended.",Information security;end user security;end user privacy;digital footprint;personal data security,IEEE

The arguments mostly concern identities in virtual reality since that is where we, as researchers and developers, have the most experience and empirical data. However, most of the argument should be applicable to augmented reality applications as well.",AI;artificial intelligence;ethics;identity;industry connections;virtual reality;white paper;XR,IEEE

With such widespread use of AI in the decision-making process, it’s necessary to build an explainable, responsible, transparent, and trustworthy AI-enabled system. With Platform and Model Design for Responsible AI, you’ll be able to make existing black box models transparent. You’ll be able to identify and eliminate bias in your models, deal with uncertainty arising from both data and model limitations, and provide a responsible AI solution. You’ll start by designing ethical models for traditional and deep learning ML models, as well as deploying them in a sustainable production setup. After that, you’ll learn how to set up data pipelines, validate datasets, and set up component microservices in a secure and private way in any cloud-agnostic framework. You’ll then build a fair and private ML model with proper constraints, tune the hyperparameters, and evaluate the model metrics. By the end of this book, you’ll know the best practices to comply with data privacy and ethics laws, in addition to the techniques needed for data anonymization. You’ll be able to develop models with explainability, store them in feature stores, and handle uncertainty in model predictions.What you will learnUnderstand the threats and risks involved in ML modelsDiscover varying levels of risk mitigation strategies and risk tiering toolsApply traditional and deep learning optimization techniques efficientlyBuild auditable and interpretable ML models and feature storesUnderstand the concept of uncertainty and explore model explainability toolsDevelop models for different clouds including AWS, Azure, and GCPExplore ML orchestration tools such as Kubeflow and Vertex AIIncorporate privacy and fairness in ML models from design to deploymentWho this book is forThis book is for experienced machine learning professionals looking to understand the risks and leakages of ML models and frameworks, and learn to develop and use reusable components to reduce effort and cost in setting up and maintaining the AI ecosystem.",,IEEE
